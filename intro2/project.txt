From the beginning he was, at best, ambivalent about the suggestion that a bill of rights would improve the Constitution as it was originally framed. The Constitutional Convention had decided against a bill of rights without much debate. During the ratification debates, the Federalists were probably surprised to learn how zealously some Antifederalists would seize upon this issue as an argument against the Constitution as a whole. Madison ultimately conceded the necessity of a bill of rights, probably more because of the vigor of the popular demand than because of the merits of their arguments. Still, Madison had his own reasons for championing the cause of a bill of rights, some of which are worth revisiting today.

Mason’s idea did win over a few adherents, but the motion lost on a tied vote following a very short and tepid debate. After a grueling summer of divisive wrangling, the delegates were exhausted.

But the brand new United States government would not be like its predecessors: its powers were already limited by being enumerated. A bill of rights, therefore, would explicitly deny to Congress powers it had never been granted in the first place. Such a proscription made no sense.  Even more ominously, the only way that such a proscription would make sense was if it were first assumed that Congress possessed implied powers, powers that were totally independent of the ones it was given in the Constitution.

He said: “The fair implication is, that they can do every thing they are not forbidden to do.” Henry’s main quarrel was not with the specific limitations that Section 9 included, however. The problem was that it did not go far enough: “The restraints in this congressional bill of rights are so feeble and few, that it would have been infinitely better to have said nothing about it.” In order to safeguard the most important liberties of the people, this Constitution required a real bill of rights.

Jefferson wrote that he was thoroughly unconvinced by the arguments from James Wilson, that a bill of rights was unnecessary in a government whose powers were already limited through enumeration. The doctrine of limited powers, he said, was “opposed by strong inferences from the body of the instrument.” He probably meant that he believed, along with Patrick Henry and “Centinel,” that certain clauses in the Constitution seemed to imply that Congress had broader powers than those specifically named in the Constitution.  Furthermore, that implication was strengthened by something else that the Constitution omitted. The Articles of Confederation had declared “in express terms” that each state would retain every power not expressly delegated to the Congress. The new Constitution did not. Jefferson concluded “that a bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular, & what no just government should refuse, or rest on inferences.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_118","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_118","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_119","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_119","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_243","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_243","title":"Jefferson writes to Madison from Paris ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_220","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_220","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_244","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_244","title":"James Madison ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_221","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_221","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_245","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_245","title":"Thomas Jefferson ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_222","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_222","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_259","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_259","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_261","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_261","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_262","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_262","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_168","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_168","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_169","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_169","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_170","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_170","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide17996","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Jefferson argues for a Bill of Rights","thumbnail":"dr/Slide17996_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si18030","si18032","Text_Caption_185","Text_Caption_186","Text_Caption_243","Image_220","Text_Caption_244","Image_221","Text_Caption_245","Image_222","Image_259","Image_261","Image_262"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide17996"}}},{"id":"si18262","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_62","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_62","title":"Demand for and Resistance to a Bill of Rights ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_42","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_42","title":"A Private Debate: James Madison and Thomas Jefferson ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_187","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_187","title":"Madison Argues Reasons Against a Bill of Rights ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_188","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_188","title":"In his reply, James Madison admitted that he had never believed the omission of a bill of rights was a “material defect” in the Constitution.

Whereas others before him had emphasized the Constitution’s democratic government or its enumerated powers as reasons why a bill of rights was unnecessary, Madison focused on its federal structure—the division of power between state and federal governments. The enumerated powers, when combined with “the jealousy of the [state] Governments, afford a security which has not existed in the case of the State Governments, and exists in no other.” The jealous state governments would operate as a check on the abuses of federal power; they would be a better check than any bill of rights ever could. Jefferson admitted that the jealousy of the state governments was “a precious reliance,” but he insisted that “they must have principles furnished them whereon to found their opposition. The declaration of rights will be the text whereby they will try all the acts of the federal government.” A bill of rights might even provide securities for the federal government as well as the states; it could protect the former whenever the states might lodge opposition against the legitimate use of federal powers.

He claimed that “experience proves the inefficacy of a bill of rights on those occasions when its controul is most needed.” State governments had been guilty of “repeated violations of these parchment barriers.” Bills of rights were ineffectual in American states for a reason, Madison thought: democratic majorities always ignored them at their convenience.  Madison had given a lot of thought to the problem of majority tyranny. The “danger of oppression” in government, he said, always arose from the quarter that held the power. A bill of rights in a monarchy can serve as a standard of legitimate power that the King must be held accountable to, and a call-to-arms in the people if it is ever transgressed. By contrast, “in a popular Government, the political and physical power may be considered as vested in the same hands, that is, in a majority of the people.” As a consequence, in democratic governments, there is no latent and opposing force strong enough to champion the cause of rights whenever they were abused by the visible power. If the majority acts like a tyrant, they cannot be checked “by the dread of an appeal to any other force within the community.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_126","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_126","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_127","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_127","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_313","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_313","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_311","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_311","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide18555","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Parchment Barriers","thumbnail":"dr/Slide18555_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si18589","si18591","Text_Caption_196","Text_Caption_197","Image_313","Image_311"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide18555"}}},{"id":"si18719","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si18721","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_66","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_66","title":"Demand for and Resistance to a Bill of Rights ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_46","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_46","title":"A Private Debate: James Madison and Thomas Jefferson ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_198","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_198","title":"Jefferson Rebuts Madison’s Arguments ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_199","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_199","title":"Jefferson thought Madison’s conclusions were too absolute.

If the country were without a bill of rights when one were needed, they would face evils that are “permanent, afflicting and irreparable: they are in constant progression from bad to worse.”  Jefferson concluded his rebuttal on an optimistic note: “I am much pleased with the prospect that a declaration of rights will be added: and hope it will be done in that way which will not endanger the whole frame of the government, or any essential part of it.” Jefferson knew he could enjoy this verbal parry and thrust with Madison free from worry, because his friend had already decided in favor of a bill of rights.  Jefferson’s letter rebutting Madison’s arguments against a bill of rights arrived only a few weeks before Madison’s proposal in the First Congress would introduce the topic, and many of Jefferson’s arguments made it into Madison’s speech before the House.

By reducing speculative truths to fundamental laws, every man of the meanest capacity and understanding may learn his own rights, and know when they are violated; a circumstance, of itself, sufficient, I conceive, to counterbalance every argument against one.  A bill of rights might not be useful as a weapon against overweening government officials, but it may make such abuses less likely. A people who have been educated in the first principles of freedom are less likely to abuse the rights of others and more likely to know when their own rights have been transgressed.

The finding of Marbury, the first exercise of judicial review by the Supreme Court, was merely that one provision in the Judiciary Act that Congress had passed in 1789 was not warranted by the Constitution.  In other words, judicial review was first used to keep the federal government within the bounds established by the Constitution.  It was many decades before the Courts used a provision from the Bill of Rights to strike down a congressional act. And the first case to do so was the Dred Scott decision of 1857, in which the Court held that outlawing slavery in the territories would deprive slaveholders of their property “without due process of law,” as required by the 5th Amendment.
