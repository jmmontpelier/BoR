He wrote a scathing satirical piece for the papers in which he suggested that the British Government “first try the effects of quartering soldiers on butchers, bakers, or other private houses” in England before exporting the experiment to her colonies. The best way to lead, after all, was by example. He pointed out that Americans were only seeking “the same protection of property and domestic security which prevails in England.”  But there was more to the controversy than simply the unprecedented intrusion on property rights and the invasion of privacy. The troops that were being quartered in America were being sent over to enforce the law in the colonies, something Samuel Adams pointed out was “far from being the original intent of soldiers.” Moreover, it seemed unacceptable to many Americans that the law authorizing the quartering of troops had been passed without the consent of the American people.

It is no accident, then, that the Declaration of Independence lists among its grievances that the King had not only assented to legislation “for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us” but also “for protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States.”   In fact, as the colonists knew, the quartering of troops under the Intolerable Acts of 1774 was done more to punish unruly Bostonians than simply as an economical means of finding a good home for British soldiers.  Americans objected so strongly to this treatment that six states subsequently included prohibitions on the quartering of soldiers in their constitutions.  Later, during the debates over ratification of the United States Constitution, several voices were heard demanding a prohibition of this kind of government intrusion.  The Antifederalist “The Federal Farmer” (No. 16) asked what provision in the Constitution would “prevent the quartering of soldiers on the inhabitants?”  He conceded that Americans were not “in any immediate danger from this quarter, yet it is fit and proper to establish, beyond dispute, those rights which are particularly valuable to individuals, and essential to the permanency and duration of free government.”   ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_742","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_742","title":"Bostonians in Distress ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_697","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_697","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_743","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_743","title":"Bostonians Paying the Excise Man ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_698","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_698","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_703","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_703","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_704","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_704","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_517","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_517","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_518","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_518","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_502","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_502","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_503","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_503","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide46768","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Historical Background II","thumbnail":"dr/Slide46768_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si46802","si46804","Text_Caption_718","Text_Caption_719","Text_Caption_742","Image_697","Text_Caption_743","Image_698","Image_703","Image_704"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide46768"}}},{"id":"si46882","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si46884","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_229","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_229","title":"The 3rd Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_136","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_136","title":"Historical Background ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_720","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_720","title":"Inclusion in the Bill of Rights ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_721","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_721","title":"In the Virginia ratification debate, Patrick Henry claimed that one of America’s “first complaints” and “one of the principal reasons for dissolving the connection with Great Britain” was the British policy of quartering troops in American homes.  Under the proposed Constitution, Henry argued, troops “may be billeted in any manner—to tyrannize, oppress, and crush us.”  Virginia was joined by other states in recommending this amendment be added to the Constitution.   What became the 3rd Amendment was included in Madison’s original proposal for a Bill of Rights, and in very similar language to its final form.  The substance of the amendment provides that no soldiers may be quartered in any house without the owner’s consent during peacetime, and during wartime it cannot be done except in accordance with law.  Only one motion was made to change the substance of the words in the First Congress.  A congressman objected that no soldiers should be permitted to quarter in private residences without the owner’s consent even in wartime.  That motion was defeated by a large majority.  Roger Sherman, taking the other extreme, thought that that the owner’s consent should not be made mandatory even in peacetime.  Nobody else responded to that suggestion.  By and large, what became the 3rd Amendment provoked very little debate or dissent, either in the First Congress or beyond.

These bases, many of which contain barracks, along with regular military pay for private housing, have largely eliminated any need to quarter soldiers in the homes of civilians.  Consequently, there have been very few court cases involving the issue.  The 3rd Amendment made a surprise appearance, however, in an extremely important case in which the Supreme Court considered a question that might have made Patrick Henry or the Federal Farmer blush:  whether a state had the right to ban contraceptives.  In Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), Justice William O. Douglas explained “that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras [partially shaded regions], formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.”  The meaning of this cryptic statement seems to be that specific provisions in the Bill of Rights imply some individual rights without stating them explicitly.  And in particular, various clauses in these amendments “create zones of privacy.”  Not only did Justice Douglas find penumbras of this zone of privacy emanating from various clauses of the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 9th Amendments, but he also took notice of the long-overlooked 3rd.  He claimed that “its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers ‘in any house’ in time of peace without the consent of the owner, is another facet of that privacy.”  Because the individual’s home is included in a person’s zone of privacy, Connecticut’s prohibitions on birth control were an unconstitutional violation of “the right of marital privacy.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_757","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_757","title":"Privacy and the 3rd Amendment ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_721","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_721","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_521","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_521","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_522","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_522","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_745","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_745","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_512","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_512","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide46928","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Application and Interpretation","thumbnail":"dr/Slide46928_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si46962","si46964","Text_Caption_723","Text_Caption_757","Image_721","Image_745"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide46928"}}},{"id":"si47042","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_231","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_231","title":"The 3rd Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_138","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_138","title":"Application and Interpretation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_724","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_724","title":"“Penumbras, formed by emanations” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_725","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_725","title":"In his dissent, Justice Stewart expressed his doubts about Douglas’ interpretive method: “As to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this Connecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States.” To cite one obvious example, “no soldier has been quartered in any house.”  Notwithstanding such objections from a minority of the Court, the “right of privacy”—found implicitly in various “penumbras, formed by emanations” in amendments such as the 3rd—has formed the basis for many important Court decisions since Griswold. Most notably, eight years after Griswold, the Court issued what was arguably the most controversial Supreme Court decision of the 20th century: Roe v. Wade (1973).
