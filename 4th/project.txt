In contrast, a specific warrant, according to Justice Joseph Story, had to “state the name of the party, [and] also the time, and place, and nature of the offence with reasonable certainty.” A specific warrant was therefore meant to protect citizens from arbitrary or unnecessary searches.

The state constitutions of Virginia, Maryland, and Massachusetts all included provisions that named the conditions under which warrants would be granted, and the first two specifically condemned general warrants. When the Confederation Congress debated the constitution submitted to them by the Philadelphia Convention, Richard Henry Lee objected that, among other defects, the proposed constitution provided no protections from unreasonable searches and seizures.   During the Virginia Ratifying Convention, George Mason objected that, under the proposed constitution, federal courts would not offer sufficient redress if federal tax collectors were to abuse their authority: “If any of the federal officers should . . . behave with the most insolent and wanton brutality to a man’s wife or daughter, where is this man to get relief?” John Marshall replied that abuses of this kind would never be allowed under the ordinary laws against trespass. Moreover, if Congress were to pass a law “to authorize [such abusive searches], it would be void.” According to Marshall, then, the 4th Amendment was not even necessary; common law prohibitions against trespass were sufficient. But in spite of Marshall’s assurances, Virginia voted to recommend an amendment that would guarantee the “right to be secure from all unreasonable searches and seizures” and that would discourage the use of general warrants.

But there is some question as to whether the First Congress really meant for the amendment to do away with general warrants altogether. At almost the same time as it debated the Bill of Rights, the First Congress also adopted the Collection Act of 1789. The Collection Act granted officers who were collecting duties “full power and authority, to enter any ship or vessel, in which they shall have reason to suspect any goods, wares or merchandise subject to duty shall be concealed, and therein to search for, seize, and secure any such goods, wares or merchandise.” In other words, it provided for a general warrant, essentially the same thing as the writs of assistance to which the colonists had so strenuously objected when British collection agents used them to search ships in Boston. Congress probably included this troublesome provision in the Collection Act because the primary means of collecting revenue in the early republic was through duties, and the First Congress was not about to take the subject of tax evasion lightly.  The Collection Act did make a distinction, however, between searching a ship and searching “any particular dwelling-house, store, building, or other place” suspected of concealing contraband. In the latter cases, searches and seizures were expected to proceed only with specific warrants obtained according to procedures similar to those found in the 4th Amendment: “upon application on oath or affirmation to any justice of the peace.” This distinction between real estate and vessels was later applied to the prohibition-era case, Carroll v. United States. Citing the 1789 Collection Act, the decision drew a distinction between searches conducted in homes and those conducted in cars or trucks.

One unresolved question simply asks: what is the relationship between its two clauses? The 4th Amendment begins by making a sweeping and defiant assertion about the private rights of individual persons, and it ends in precise and legalistic language describing the conditions under which a warrant may be obtained. The first clause declares that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” The second clause specifies that “no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The second clause is fairly clear and uncontroversial. But there have been many heated debates over the meaning of the first clause and its relationship to the second clause.  Some people have argued that the second clause (outlining the conditions under which a warrant must be obtained) of the amendment was simply meant to provide guidance for determining whether or not searches and seizures are deemed “unreasonable” under the first clause. But the story is more complicated than that. There have always been situations in which no warrant was required in order to validate a search or seizure. But which situations ought to qualify for an exception to the warrant requirement?

For almost a hundred years after the passage of the 4th Amendment, few people objected to the use of such tainted evidence at trial. The issue was tested in 1822, in United States v. La Jeune, when the defense argued that certain evidence should be inadmissible in court because it was obtained improperly. Justice Story responded that such “evidence is admissible on charges for the highest crimes, even though it may have been obtained by a trespass upon the person, or by any other forcible and illegal means.” Story acknowledged that evidence is sometimes acquired contrary to law, yet he was “not aware, that such evidence has upon that account ever been dismissed for incompetency.” A defendant who was the victim of an unreasonable search and seizure might still be able to sue for damages against the offending ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_745","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_745","title":"officer, but only for the improper search or seizure, not for any damages incurred by subsequent criminal prosecution.

This “exclusionary rule” was controversial from the moment it was announced, and the controversy continues to this day. Those who defend the exclusionary rule essentially argue that, without it, the police have strong incentives to engage in unreasonable searches and no countervailing incentive to obey the 4th Amendment.   Supporters of the rule also argue that using ill-gotten evidence compounds the original injury.

In the case of evidence discovered by an improper search and seizure, the exclusionary rule places a victim in the same condition he or she would have been in if the Constitution had never been violated.  Ultimately, the exclusionary rule is meant to prevent future abuses by the police. Indeed, Justice Stewart, in Elkins v. United States (1960), claimed that deterrence was its only purpose. Denying that the rule would offer any kind of reparations, he asserted instead: “Its purpose is to deter—to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way—by removing the incentive to disregard it.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_748","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_748","title":"Those who oppose the exclusionary rule have argued that the guilt of the offending officer does not absolve the suspect of his own crime, and excluding important evidence will allow criminals to escape judgment. Furthermore, suppressing evidence does not place a suspect in the same condition he would be in if it were never discovered; it places him in a better position. If the evidence had not been obtained through an improper search, there would still be a chance that it could be discovered through proper channels. In many cases, therefore, excluding evidence effectively hands a suspect a get-out-of-jail-free card.   Opponents of the exclusionary rule would prefer to enforce the 4th Amendment in the same way that it was enforced during its first hundred years: by making the offending officer liable for damages. Opponents to this argument counter that very few convicted criminals could convince juries to award them damages for the illegal searches that led to their convictions. Moreover, even innocent people would be unlikely to file such a lawsuit, especially considering that police officers are immune from civil liability so long as they can show that they were acting in good faith.

Justice Burger claimed in 1971 that if Congress were to review the 50-year history since the exclusionary rule was enforced, it would find “thousands of cases in which the criminal was set free because the constable blundered and virtually no evidence that innocent victims of police error . . . have been afforded meaningful redress” (Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents).  Finally, those who defend the exclusionary rule claim that it often forces some clarification of the meaning of an unreasonable search. If the courts did not rule on this question when considering whether evidence was admissible, the question would be unlikely to come up except in the exceptional case when a suspect sues a police department for damages. On the other hand, its detractors would argue that the numerous and varied circumstances under which evidence is now scrutinized for its admissibility only add to the complexities, confusions, and inconsistencies in our interpretation of the 4th Amendment.  In 1961, the 4th Amendment was incorporated against the states by the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court decided in Mapp v. Ohio that any evidence gained through an improper search was inadmissible whether the trial was held in a state or a federal court. Even before its incorporation, however, many states had already added exclusionary rules to their interpretations of their own state constitutions.

And police may arrest a person outside of his home without a warrant as long as they have probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime. They may also search property without a warrant if “exigent circumstances” exist—situations in which time is of the essence, for example, when people are in danger or evidence is being destroyed. In addition, the police have some discretionary powers to search automobiles (which can be easily moved), to conduct searches “incident to arrest” (to “frisk” suspects to make sure they are not armed), and to search prisons and jails.

But moving vehicles have long been treated as a separate class of property subject to warrantless search. As early as 1925, Chief Justice Taft articulated the difference in Carroll v. United States. Noting that the First Congress drew a distinction between the searches of ships and homes in the Collection Act of 1789, he concluded that the Court was justified in distinguishing between “the necessity for a search warrant between goods subject to forfeiture, when concealed in a dwelling house or similar place, and like goods in course of transportation and concealed in a movable vessel where they readily could be put out of reach of a search warrant.” The grounds for drawing a distinction between moving vehicles and other forms of property have changed, but the distinction itself has a long history.

In one recent case, Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders (2012), Albert Florence claimed a violation of his 4th Amendment rights because he was subjected to two strip searches after being arrested for failure to pay a fine for a traffic violation (although not legally relevant, it is interesting to note that the fine had already been paid at the time he was arrested). The Court decided that such searches were not unreasonable under the 4th Amendment. Justice Kennedy, delivering the opinion of the Court, asserted that any rule that required prison officials to separate those prisoners likely to be carrying contraband from those who were not would be “unworkable” in practice: “The record provides evidence that the seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband and that it would be difficult in practice to determine whether individual detainees fall within the proposed exemption.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_522","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_522","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_801","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_801","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide48490","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Prison Searches","thumbnail":"dr/Slide48490_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si48491","si48493","Image_769","Text_Caption_764","Text_Caption_765","Image_801"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide48490"}}},{"id":"si48604","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si48606","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_770","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_770","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_248","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_248","title":"The 4th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_155","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_155","title":"Airport Screenings ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_767","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_767","title":"Recent controversy over the meaning of “unreasonable searches” has been sparked in response to the heightened security at airports following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. New body scanners are able to create what are essentially nude images of passengers, images which are then viewed by anonymous TSA agents. Passengers may opt out of being scanned, but those who do so (and those who are flagged due to an irregularity in the electronic screening process) must submit to “enhanced pat-downs.” These physical searches require federal agents to feel a passenger’s groin area and place their hands between a woman’s breasts. Instances of unwanted touching that under other circumstances would be subject to criminal prosecution are now often required if a passenger wishes to board a plane. One outraged San Diego man told an airport security screener, “If you touch my junk I’ll have you arrested.” The man ultimately chose to forfeit his airline ticket rather than submit to the pat-down.    In a 1973 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case, United States v. Davis, random airport searches (which at the time typically included only metal detectors and rummaging through carry-on baggage) were upheld because they were “administrative screenings” designed to prevent weapons from entering planes; they were not designed to find evidence of criminality. One important consideration in Davis was that a person may avoid screening altogether by electing not to fly. The Court ruled, however, that “to meet the test of reasonableness [under the 4th Amendment], an administrative screening search must be as limited in its intrusiveness as is consistent with satisfaction of the administrative need that justifies it.” The question is: Does society’s admittedly compelling interest in safe air travel justify the intrusiveness of today’s TSA procedures?

As a consequence, they perhaps left open more questions than they answered. Justice Scalia, delivering the opinion of the Court, decided the case on very narrow grounds. He pointed out that “for most of our history the Fourth Amendment was understood to embody a particular concern for government trespass upon the areas (‘persons, houses, papers, and effects’) it enumerates.” Relying on an older standard for determining what constitutes a “search,” Scalia limited his analysis to the two facts that 1) a physical trespass had occurred (when the officers attached the GPS device to the underside of Jones’ Jeep); and 2) information was gathered as a result of this trespass (when officers tracked the movements of the Jeep for four weeks). Based on these two facts alone, Scalia concluded: “We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a ‘search’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was adopted.”   The concurring justices, while not denying Scalia’s reasoning, seemed impatient to decide the question on grounds that would offer guidance for those potential (and inevitable) circumstances when a physical trespass would not be necessary in order to gather the same information electronically. Since Katz v. United States (1967), the Court has relied on the rule that the government cannot intrude upon a person’s “reasonable expectation of privacy,” even when no physical trespass takes place. Scalia declined to consider the possible applicability of the Katz rule to this case, since the older understanding of the 4th Amendment sufficed to settle the question.

Without stricter guidance, the relatively cheap and easy surveillance methods made possible by advanced technology would allow “the government to ascertain, more or less at will, [people’s] political and religious beliefs, sexual habits, and so on.” Even if the police did not need to intrude upon people’s private property in order to gather this information, this unfettered power would nonetheless be inimical to “the Fourth Amendment’s goal to curb arbitrary exercises of police power.”  Justice Alito, in another concurring opinion, echoed these concerns and suggested that the Katz test was a more ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_805","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_805","title":"relevant standard for modern cases involving electronic surveillance. Nevertheless, Alito conceded that the Katz test opened up its own set of problems, especially since “reasonable expectations of privacy” altered over time and were themselves influenced by technological advances. People used to expect a greater degree of privacy before the age of cell phones and social media websites. For that reason, he concluded: “In circumstances involving dramatic technological change, the best solution to privacy concerns may be legislative.” This attempt by the judges to punt the question of electronic surveillance to the legislative branch again emphasizes the difficult and inconsistency inherent in 4th Amendment jurisprudence.
