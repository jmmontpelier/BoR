Even the Supreme Court seems to feel that way: the 7th Amendment is one of the few parts of the Bill of Rights that the Court does not consider important enough to apply to the states. But when the Constitution was first being debated, disagreements about these issues threatened to derail ratification.  Part of the problem is that the two issues addressed in the 7th Amendment are very specific legal concepts that most people never encounter: civil jury trials and appellate review of those jury trials.  Most people know what a jury is—it is a small group, typically six to twelve people, who sit in a special place in a courtroom, watch a trial, and then decide what the facts are. After the jury determines the facts in a case, a judge applies the law to those facts. As a concept, this seems simple enough.

There is, however, another area of law called civil law that, while it may not be as dramatic as criminal law, is also quite important. Civil Law comprises essentially everything other than criminal law. In a civil case, the parties are not arguing over sending someone to jail; rather, they are arguing, typically, over money. Sometimes they’re arguing over a lot of money, as in some of the tobacco cases of the 1900s, which resulted in settlements of billions of dollars. If one is sued in a civil lawsuit, he will come to know how important they are. He may be at risk of losing everything he has—at least his material things, like money and property.  Most people have also seen fictionalized appellate arguments on television, as when the lawyers on Law & Order argue to a panel of judges rather than to a jury. But relatively few know the purpose of an appeal. An appeal is not merely a second trial (although it may result in one). Rather it is a post-trial legal proceeding in which a party, usually the party that lost in a previous trial, can argue to a higher authority that the trial court made some kind of mistake, either of law or fact. If the appellate court agrees that the trial court erred, then the appellate court can order a different result in the case, ranging from a complete reversal to an order for a new trial—what we might call a do-over.

Basically, because they perceived juries as being important checks on governmental power. And they were, at least during the colonial era, when (as the Declaration of Independence protests) judges were made dependent on the King’s will for their tenures and salaries. Those judges sometimes ruled in ways with which the American colonists strongly disagreed. But juries—made of up colonists—sometimes prevented the judges from issuing such rulings, even going so far as to make factual findings that effectively “nullified” laws that the colonists considered unjust. So Americans of the Founding Era trusted juries far more than they trusted judges.  That is what accounts for both clauses of the 7th Amendment: the first clause guarantees jury trials in civil cases, and the second clause prevents appellate judges from inappropriately undoing jury verdicts.

Secondly, Congress could be trusted to decide how to arrange the matter. Edmund Randolph in Virginia conceded that the right “is not so expressly secured as I should wish it,” but he nonetheless assured his colleagues: “I will risk my property on the certainty that [Congress] will institute the trial by jury in such manner as shall accommodate the conveniences of the inhabitants in every state.” Then he added what should have been the clincher: “Can it be in any manner advantageous for them to suppress it?” Why would Congress subvert legal proceedings between private citizens?

This would have been easily done, if they had been at the trouble of writing five or six lines.” Others accused the Framers of more than neglect: they suspected a deliberate and sinister design. In New York, one Antifederalist advanced the theory that it was possible to “deduce, from the positive establishment of the trial by jury in criminal cases, that it is annihilated in civil.” This accusation was frequently repeated. Patrick Henry asked: “How does your trial by jury stand? In civil cases gone.” Some Antifederalists argued that the fate of civil jury trials was even more precarious because the Constitution gave the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction “both as to law and fact.” That would allow the Supreme Court to nullify the decisions of any jury.

Moreover, several states proposed to limit the federal appellate power to a review of the legal rulings of judges, thus preventing federal appeals courts from reviewing the factual findings of juries.  Madison originally proposed two separate amendments to address these two distinct requests. His proposal had suggested that “no appeal to [the Supreme Court] shall be allowed where the value in controversy shall not amount to --- dollars: nor shall any fact triable by jury, according to the course of common law, be otherwise re-examinable than may consist with the principles of common law.” The “value in controversy” provision was designed as an additional limit to the appellate power of the federal courts, something also requested by some states.

As Patrick Henry had pointed out in the Virginia Ratifying Convention: “There is no common law of America.” In United States v. Wonson (1812), Justice Story would have to provide an answer to that question. Story wrote of the 7th Amendment: “Beyond all question, the common law here alluded to is not the common law of any individual state (for it probably differs in all), but it is the common law of England, the grand reservoir of all our jurisprudence.” Judges since that time have drawn from that decision a principle that “suits at common law” means the common law of England, at least as it stood in the year 1791 when the Bill of Rights was ratified.  In an ironic twist, the issue at the heart of the 7th Amendment, the issue that has been of such importance to the American Founders—the guarantee of jury trials in civil cases—has been far less important to modern Americans than to their forebears. Perhaps we trust independent American judges more than we once trusted judges who were beholden to the Crown. This is reflected in the U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to “incorporate” the 7th Amendment’s first clause “against the states.” When determining whether the individual rights named in the Bill of Rights should be applied to the states through the 14th Amendment, the Court will ask whether that right “is fundamental to the American scheme of justice” [Duncan v. Louisiana (1968)]. However, as with the 5th Amendment’s grand jury requirement, the Court has decided that the 7th Amendment’s civil jury trial guarantee is not fundamental. It is therefore not enforceable against the states.

It has not quite worked out that way. The last part of the Reexamination Clause, the part that makes an exception for appellate review of jury findings “according to the rules of common law,” means that, if American federal courts determine that the common law of Britain in 1791 allowed a British judge to “re-examine” facts found by juries, then the American courts can do the same thing.

Indeed, in modern practice, federal appellate courts frequently review facts found by juries and sometimes reverse what the juries have done.  However, federal appellate courts generally give much more deference to jury findings than they give to the conclusions of law reached by trial judges. This greater deference is reflected in the differing “standards of review” used by appellate courts to review the decisions of juries and judges. Appellate courts will typically only reverse a jury’s findings of fact if those findings are “clearly erroneous.” But those same appellate courts will typically give the trial judge’s legal findings no deference at all—they will review the law “de novo,” that is, as if they were looking at it for the first time.

Some had even feared that the Supreme Court would overturn civil jury decisions arising from state courts through an abuse of its appellate power. Although the addition of the 7th Amendment has no doubt made a difference to the course of American jurisprudence, it has not been as influential as some of the other amendments. In the first place, it is one of the few guarantees found in the Bill of Rights that has never been applied to state governments through incorporation of the 14th Amendment. And in the second place, some findings of juries have still been overturned using the Supreme Court’s appellate power. This was done by labeling certain jury decisions (namely, damage rewards) a question of law rather than fact.
