Indeed, navigating his list of proposed amendments through both houses of Congress was a task that would take all of Madison’s tenacity and skill. A formidable cadre of congressmen believed that it was too soon to be talking about amendments, and they repeatedly delayed Madison’s measures. Then, once he succeeded in bringing his proposal forward, many other congressmen objected that his amendments were insufficient.  Through will power and political finesse, Madison finally managed to win the assent of two-thirds of both houses of Congress for a list of twelve proposed amendments. Ten of these were adopted by the states by 1791, becoming the Bill of Rights we know today.

His change of heart may have come about in part because of the persuasions of his good friend, Thomas Jefferson.   But Madison’s change of heart was also politically motivated. Many voters in the congressional district surrounding his home county of Orange were anxious to see a bill of rights in the new Constitution. Some of his constituency were skeptical that this candidate, who had once expressed doubts about the necessity of a bill of rights, was the right man to get the job done. To them, Madison’s rival, the erstwhile Antifederalist James Monroe, may have seemed like a safer bet. During Madison’s candidacy, he wrote a few carefully worded letters—directed to men who would be sure to leak the  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_185","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_185","title":"information to the proper channels—assuring them that his devotion to a bill of rights was sincere.   In one letter to George Eve, Madison explained that his earlier opposition had primarily been toward “previous alterations;” that is, he objected to a ratification of the Constitution that would be contingent on the adoption of specified amendments. His resistance had lasted only while the ratification was in doubt, but with the adoption of the Constitution, “circumstances are now changed.” If the First Congress and the states were to adopt carefully chosen amendments to the Constitution now, then it “may serve the double purpose of satisfying the minds of well meaning opponents, and of providing additional guards in favour of liberty.”  Madison’s reassuring letters—one of which was published in a Richmond paper less than a week before the election—must have had some effect, for he won the election by a comfortable margin. And Madison remained faithful to his campaign pledges. He crafted his own proposal for a bill of rights and then worked tirelessly to push it through the First Congress.

When Virginia sent a list of proposed amendments along with its ratification, it specified that it was addressed to “the Congress which shall first assemble under the said Constitution.” If the First Congress failed to acknowledge their request, it would appear like a snub.  Madison believed that the circumstances under which some of the states agreed to the ratification of the Constitution formed a “tacit compact” that amendments would subsequently be added. He later confided to a friend that he believed that, in Virginia at least, the Constitution “would have been certainly rejected, had no assurances been given by its advocates that such provisions would be pursued. As an honest man I feel my self bound by this consideration.” As an honest man, furthermore, he felt it his duty to see the business through personally.

He wanted Congress to propose modest but popular amendments as soon as possible “in order to extinguish opposition to the system, or at least break the force of it, by detaching the deluded opponents from their designing leaders.” Until that was done, Congress could not even embark on other necessary business with confidence.

On May 4, he gave the House notice that, while he understood that many other pressing matters needed to take precedence, he intended to bring the matter forward on May 25. Other business made that date impossible, and his proposal was postponed.  Madison finally succeeded in commanding the attention of the House on June 8, when he restated his intention to formally introduce a proposal for amendments to the Constitution. This news was greeted by a succession of speakers arguing that such a discussion was premature. James Jackson of Georgia protested that “we ought not to be in a hurry” with amendments; only experience could suggest which ones were really necessary. Aedanus Burke agreed that “this was not the proper time to bring them forward. Among the most strenuous objections to Madison’s timing, for example, was that Congress had more urgent business: it first needed to establish a reliable stream of revenue.  Others pointed out that the clamor for amending the Constitution was hardly universal. Only five of the eleven states that had ratified the Constitution had requested that amendments be added. Representatives from Georgia and Delaware noted that their own states had unanimously approved the existing Constitution, and Connecticut’s Roger Sherman reminded the House that his state had “adopted this system by a very great majority.” These states wished Congress to attend to those matters that the Constitution, as it had been adopted, actually charged them with undertaking.

In the lengthy speech he delivered to a mostly hostile crowd, he gave closely reasoned arguments why a bill of rights was appropriate to this Constitution and why the House should take up the matter without delay. Many of these arguments were derived from his correspondence with Jefferson. In addition, Madison asserted—on four separate occasions that day—that he considered that it was his duty to bring forward these amendments at an early date.   Nearly every member who rose to reply to Madison’s proposal spoke against it. Either it was wrong in itself, or brought forward at the wrong time, or brought about in the wrong way. Those who wanted to hurry the business or sweep it aside suggested submitting Madison’s proposal to a special committee. The committee would consider the matter separately and then make a report to the whole House. Several members intimated to Madison that, by merely bringing the matter forward, or passing it off to a select committee, he had discharged his duty. Now he could give it a rest.

He said it was offering something “like a tub thrown out to a whale” (a decoy meant to keep a whaling ship safe). Madison replied that he believed that the protections for individual rights were the amendments that had received the broadest support. Concerning those which related to more substantial changes in the Constitution, he predicted that “there is little prospect of obtaining the consent of two-thirds of both houses of Congress, and three-fourths of the state legislatures.” He was therefore “a friend to what is attainable.”  Burke repeated that the proposed amendments were nothing “like the amendments required by the states of New York, Virginia, New Hampshire and Carolina.” And he waved the states’ proposals before the House “to show the difference, concluding that all the important amendments were omitted in the report.” He had a point. Every state that had recommended amendments had wished to place limits on congressional taxing powers. By contrast, only Virginia and North Carolina had demanded a separate bill of rights. Madison’s emphasis on a bill of rights was therefore a way of diffusing the opposition to the Constitution while at the same time carefully avoiding those substantive changes that he and other Federalists opposed.

But the House did not take Gerry’s bait. Nor did the Senate, when Richard Henry Lee attempted the same maneuver in that body. Madison had been correct in his political assessment: there was not enough support in either House to convince two-thirds of its members to adopt the more substantial amendments proposed by the states.

Part of the amicable and expeditious quality of the debates may have been attributable to the pressing business that Congress was postponing in order to take up the bill of rights. Even more important, however, was the familiarity of the rights themselves. Most members of Congress already accepted the rights that were proposed as being longstanding safeguards of liberty.  The most frequent remaining disagreements were over the specific wording of some of these guarantees. Madison’s proposal went through numerous alterations and abridgments in the House, first in a select committee and then a Committee of the Whole. Beginning on August 19, the House debated the amendments anew sitting formally as the House of Representatives.

Having failed in their exertions, they could only anticipate with dread “the necessary tendency to consolidated Empire” if the Constitution were not “further Amended.” Its opponents in Virginia’s legislature managed to delay approval of the Bill of Rights, but the tide had definitely turned against the Antifederalists.  By and large, the United States had learned to embrace its new Constitution, and the proposed amendments were warmly received by the states. James Madison wrote to President Washington that, “as far as I can gather, the great bulk of the late opponents are entirely at rest.” He predicted that, if the delaying tactics of Virginia’s Antifederalists were construed by the public as a way to reignite “the war against the General Government, I am of opinion the experiment will recoil on the authors.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_291","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_291","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide21002","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Opposition to the Bill of Rights Dwindles","thumbnail":"dr/Slide21002_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si21145","si21147","Text_Caption_249","Text_Caption_250","Image_291"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide21002"}}},{"id":"si22696","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si22698","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_74","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_74","title":"The Making of the Bill of Rights ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_51","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_51","title":"Ratifying the Ten Amendments that Became the Bill of Rights ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_251","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_251","title":"Adoption of the Bill of Rights, 1791 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_252","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_252","title":"The United States Bill of Rights was adopted on December 15, 1791, when Virginia became the eleventh state to ratify all but the first two amendments proposed by Congress.

For one thing, they were appended to the back of the Constitution, instead of being prefixed to the beginning. Second, they had no hortatory statements about the rights of man and the purpose of government (something that was a part of Madison’s original proposal but which the House rejected). And finally, some of the provisions in these ten amendments—particularly the 9th and 10th—were entirely new, and did not seem to match people’s conceptions of what a bill of rights ought to be. Be that as it may, these ten amendments have since become the gold standard for bills of rights in American states ever since. Indeed, they have served as a model for the entire world.

States entertained almost paranoid fears that Congress would use that provision to extinguish free elections altogether.  Similarly, the Constitution had stipulated that direct taxes must be “in Proportion to the Census”—which included the three-fifths provision for slaves—but it had placed no limitations on how high the rate of direct taxes might go, nor on how intrusive the federal government might become when collecting them. Every state that had recommended amendments had requested limitations on Congress’ power of taxation. Many states had argued that, at the very least, Congress should not be empowered to exercise either power—over elections or direct taxation—unless the states had failed to act.
