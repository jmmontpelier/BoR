The Statute of Westminster I (1275) set out a list of offenses that were to be subject to bail and which were not. This statute was altered from time to time, but it served the courts as a guide for centuries. Nonetheless, the courts, often with interference from the King, sometimes subverted the statute’s intentions. In 1628, King Charles I imprisoned a few knights, among whom was Thomas Darnel, for refusing to participate in his policy of forced loans. When they appealed their imprisonment on a Writ of Habeas Corpus, the court refused bail out of deference to the prerogatives of the crown. “Darnel’s Case” became the incentive for Parliament’s Petition of Right of 1628, which clarified and gave more force to the rights of the accused.  The following decades saw a number of maneuvers and counter-maneuvers between courts, Crown, and Parliament. Some judges, loyal to the King, would lay heavy fines against his enemies and then jail them for nonpayment. The courts also sought to prevent the release of prisoners by setting bail amounts so high that they could not be paid. In response to various abuses, Parliament added to the English Bill of Rights of 1689 the provision: “That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.” These words are almost exactly those eventually adopted into the 8th Amendment of the U.S. Bill of Rights.

Many legal experts, such as Justice Reed, who delivered the Court’s opinion in Carlson v. Landon (1952), have believed that they did: “The bail clause was lifted with slight changes from the English Bill of Rights Act. In England that clause has never been thought to accord a right to bail in all cases, but merely to provide that bail shall not be excessive in those cases where it is proper to grant bail.” In other words, the provision is a limitation on the judges’ discretion to set bail; it is not a restraint on legislative authority.

The 1641 Massachusetts Body of Liberties, for instance, guaranteed bail to every suspect except those accused of a capital crime or contempt of court. Several state constitutions likewise included a provision that “all prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offenses, when the proof is evident, or presumption great.” Those state provisions were also copied into contemporaneous federal documents, such as the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Judiciary Act of 1789.  These “bailable” provisions did not limit the amount of bail that can be set by judges; rather, they limit the power of Congress to define the types of crimes that can be denied bail. Nonetheles, the very fact that the “bailable” clause was always a separate provision—one that was not included in many state constitutions that had an “excessive bail” clause nor in the Bill of Rights—seems to suggest that the two concepts cannot be conflated. As the wording of the 1780 Massachusetts Declaration of Rights makes plain, the “excessive bail” clause was not intended as a limitation on the legislature: “No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_600","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_600","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_601","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_601","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide54259","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Excessive Bail in America","thumbnail":"dr/Slide54259_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si54293","Text_Caption_851","Text_Caption_852","Text_Caption_853"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide54259"}}},{"id":"si54380","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si54382","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_278","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_278","title":"The 8th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_168","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_168","title":"Application and Interpretation ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_854","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_854","title":"Excessive Bails and Fines ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_855","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_855","title":"When determining what amount of bail should be deemed within acceptable limits and what amount would be “excessive,” the Court has determined that the test must be governed by the purpose of granting bail: ensuring that a criminal defendant shows up at his trial. The 8th Amendment, they concluded, requires that bail not be set “at a figure higher than an amount reasonably calculated” to ensure that the accused does not skip town [Star v. Boyle (1951)]. When calculating that amount, courts may take into account the financial standing and past actions of the accused as well as the nature of the crime. Courts may also consider whether the accused, if free, would post a thread to the community [United States v. Goba (2003)].  The Supreme Court has never explicitly applied this clause to the states (or “incorporated” it against them). Nonetheless, in Schilb v. Kuebel (1971), the Court declared that “the Eighth Amendment’s proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.”  The Court has had relatively few run-ins with the “excessive fines” clause. There is little guidance in the historical record to shed light on what “excessive” might mean. In United States v. Bajakajian (1998), the Court declared that a fine would have to be “grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant’s offense” in order to violate the 8th Amendment.

In other words, Parliament did not have in mind a set list of punishments that could never be inflicted; rather, they wanted to ensure that punishments were established by law rather than invented, on the spur of the moment, by vindictive judges.  American colonists, however, generally took a broader view of that clause. The English, after all, had invented some rather nasty forms of punishment throughout the course of their history. Anyone who has seen the movie Braveheart will not soon forget the scene in which William Wallace (played by Mel Gibson) was disemboweled—slowly—in front of a jeering crowd.  Even as late as 1769, the legal commentator William Blackstone could still list a catalogue of horrors that remained in England’s penal code: “emboweling alive, beheading, and quartering” (that trio is one punishment) and public dissection or being burned alive. Blackstone nonetheless commends the English practice as being milder than its laws. It hardly ever happened that a person is “emboweled or burned, till previously deprived of sensation by strangling.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_889","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_889","title":"Titus Oates ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_890","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_890","title":"Sir Thomas Armstrong ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_807","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_807","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_814","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_814","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_816","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_816","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_604","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_604","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_605","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_605","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_821","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_821","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_593","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_593","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_594","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_594","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide54426","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Cruel and Unusual Punishment","thumbnail":"dr/Slide54426_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si54460","si54462","Text_Caption_856","Text_Caption_857","Text_Caption_889","Text_Caption_890","Image_807","Image_814","Image_816","Image_821"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide54426"}}},{"id":"si54540","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si54542","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_280","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_280","title":"The 8th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_170","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_170","title":"Preventing Cruel and Unusual Punishment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_858","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_858","title":"1778 Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_859","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_859","title":"Americans during the Founding were generally proud of the fact that they, in keeping with such an enlightened age, were in the process of putting this sort of barbarism behind them. Thomas Jefferson had criticized some of the disproportionate, cruel, and bloodthirsty penal codes of colonial Virginia and sought to make them more “proportionate and mild.” Nonetheless, some of the suggestions he made in his 1778 Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments would today seem to us as being a little on the harsh side. For instance, he advocated that rapists should be castrated; those who maim another “shall be maimed or disfigured in like sort”; those who are guilty of larceny should be sentenced to the pillory followed by hard labor; and those guilty of “the pretended arts of witchcraft” should be punished with ducking (tied to a chair and forced underwater) and whipping. Jefferson himself was not entirely sold on the punishments of castrating and maiming, but they were acceptable as a substitute for their alternative, which was usually death.  Indeed, one of Jefferson’s primary goals in this bill was to limit capital punishments to the crimes of murder and treason. For Jefferson, the avoidance of cruel and unusual punishments began with “a duty in the legislature” to set forth mild and proportionate punishments, and it was consummated in a judiciary that is bound by that code. Jefferson had articulated this two-pronged approach to avoid “cruel and unusual punishments” in a letter two years earlier: “Let mercy be the character of the law-giver, but let the judge be a mere machine.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_606","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_606","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_607","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_607","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_899","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_899","title":"Bill of Proportioning Punishments ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_822","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_822","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_826","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_826","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_624","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_624","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide54506","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Preventing Cruel and Unusual Punishment","thumbnail":"dr/Slide54506_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si54540","si54542","Text_Caption_858","Text_Caption_859","Text_Caption_899","Image_822","Image_826"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide54506"}}},{"id":"si54620","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_281","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_281","title":"The 8th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_171","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_171","title":"The Addition of the 8th Amendment into the Bill of Rights ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_860","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_860","title":"Ratifying Debates ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_861","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_861","title":"It is likely that the 8th Amendment’s prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments” was originally intended to restrict all three branches of government from inflicting either arbitrary or sadistic punishments.

Such restraint had already been imposed on some state legislatures. Patrick Henry praised the authors of Virginia’s Declaration of Rights because “they would not admit of tortures.” George Mason concurred, saying that Virginia’s “bill of rights provided that no cruel and unusual punishments shall be inflicted; therefore, torture was included in the prohibition.” And later, Joseph Story, writing his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833, explained  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_862","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_862","title":"that “the cause holds out a wide admonition to all departments of the National Government, to warn them against such violent proceedings, and to instruct them in the duties of clemency and moderation.

Nobody disputes that, at the time that the 8th Amendment was adopted, the vast majority of Americans did not believe that the death penalty constituted “cruel and unusual punishment.” There were, however, some outliers. The Quakers were opposed to capital punishment, and they had a significant influence on Pennsylvanian politics and law. Benjamin Rush, a prominent political leader in Pennsylvania, wrote a condemnation of capital punishment in 1792 which drew its reasons from natural rights, public policy, religion, and republican principles. Most men at the time, however, simply assumed that the death penalty was the appropriate punishment for the worst crimes. The strongest proof for its general acceptance comes from the Constitution itself. The 5th Amendment twice refers to what is required in capital trial proceedings.

In 1958, the Court held that: “The Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society” (Trop v. Dulles). Even though the case had nothing to do with capital punishments, opponents of the death penalty quickly embraced its “evolving standards of decency” language. Justice Thurgood Marshall, quoting from the Trop decision less than 15 years later, stressed that “a penalty that was permissible at one time in our Nation’s history is not necessarily permissible today” [Furman v. Georgia (1972)]. According to Marshall, even if “the Court, or individual Justices, may have in the past expressed an opinion that the death penalty is constitutional,” the “evolving standards” concept means that those past decisions are “not now binding on us.” In other words,  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_871","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_871","title":"even though capital punishment was never found to be unconstitutional under 8th Amendment grounds in the past, it might be in the future.  Of course, other justices have disagreed with Marshall, and indeed, the Court has never struck down the death penalty. But it has chipped away at it. From the late 1960s through much of the 1970s there was a de facto moratorium on death sentences arising out of a number of court cases. These cases did not invalidate the death penalty per se, but there were a number of objections to the ways that capital cases were tried and the manner in which the penalty was applied. In the 1972 Furman case, Justice Stewart pronounced: “I simply conclude that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly imposed.” And in 1975, the Court struck down a law that required a mandatory death sentence for first degree murder (Woodson v. North Carolina).

In Coker v. Georgia (1976), the Court found that it was unconstitutional to authorize a sentence of death for a conviction of rape or any other crime where a life was not taken. The 8th Amendment finding was based on the reasoning that the punishment was “grossly disproportionate” to the crime.  More recently, the Court has restricted even further the severity of punishments that can be meted out to other categories of criminals. In a couple of cases in the 1980s it was determined that only major accomplices in a felony murder conviction can be sentenced to death. In 2001, the Court in Atkins v. Virginia found that it was unconstitutional to execute the mentally ill. In Roper v. Simmons (2005), the Court struck down capital punishment for juvenile offenders. Voicing the Court’s decision, Justice Kennedy said that “it is worth noting that the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is itself a severe sanction, in particular for a young person.” Then, seven years later, in Miller v. Alabama, the Court prohibited laws that prescribed mandataory life imprisonment for juveniles, no matter the severity of the crime. Justice Kagan, delivering the opinion of the Court, wrote that “the mandatory sentencing schemes before us violate this principle of proportionality, and so the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_616","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_616","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_617","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_617","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_910","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_910","title":"The Founders and the Death Penalty ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_838","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_838","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_839","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_839","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_631","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_631","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide54964","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Convictions other than murder and treason","thumbnail":"dr/Slide54964_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si54998","si55000","Text_Caption_872","Text_Caption_873","Text_Caption_910","Image_838","Image_839"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide54964"}}},{"id":"si55078","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si55080","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_286","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_286","title":"The 8th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_176","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_176","title":"The Death Penalty ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_874","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_874","title":"Differing Opinions on the Death Penalty ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_875","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_875","title":"In a speech that Justice Brennan delivered in 1985, he gave it as his opinion that the proper interpretation of the 8th Amendment would forbid all cases of capital punishment, although he acknowledged that the majority of Supreme Court justices, as well as the majority of Americans, disagreed with him. He was hoping with this opinion, he said, “to embody a community striving for human dignity for all, although perhaps not yet arrived.”  Many people have accused the Court of overstepping its authority by deciding cases on such a flexible and ill-defined basis as “evolving standards of decency.” Justice Scalia, in his Roper dissent, argued that the Court had based its decision on select scientific reports (ignoring others), select state practices (ignoring others), and laws of other nations when making its decision. In short, they looked to anything and everything except the traditional meaning of the “cruel and unusual punishment” clause of the 8th Amendment. He accused the Court of “undertak[ing] the majestic task of determining (and thereby prescribing) our Nation’s current standards of decency.”  Chief Justice Roberts, writing the dissent in the Miller case, proffered a similar argument: “Determining the appropriate sentence for a teenager convicted of murder presents grave and challenging questions of morality and social policy,” questions which are appropriate for a legislature. “Our role, however, is to apply the law, not to answer such questions.” He added that, since mandatory life sentences for teenagers had been accepted by a majority of states, they therefore “could not plausibly be described” as unusual.

For example, in the 1824 Pennsylvania case, James v. Commonwealth, Justice Duncan launched into a lengthy discourse on the practice of ducking. This sentence—always delivered against women and usually upon the conviction of being a “scold” (we’re not kidding)—involved tying the criminal to a stool and ducking her under water. Duncan, after establishing that the punishment had not been used in England for most of the last 100 years and had never been embraced by Pennsylvania, argued that punishments “may be repealed either expressly or by implication founded on disuse.” The court stressed that it was not even taking “into consideration the humane provisions” in the 8th Amendment when making this decision. And other court cases and commentaries at the time stressed that the “cruel and unusual punishment” provision was not an absolute bar to the legislature if it chose to formulate more stringent punishments for some crimes (such as dueling) when the needs of society demanded it. The provision therefore left some discretion in the hands of legislatures.
