The Articles of Confederation had included a provision that stated: “Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right, which is not by this confederation expressly delegated to the United States.”  The Federalists rejected this language because under the new Constitution, each state would not retain all of its sovereignty, and the new federal government had deliberately been given more powers than those that had been delegated “expressly.”  Indeed, when the Constitutional Convention first submitted its new plan of government to Congress, it sent an accompanying letter that explained that it was impossible “to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to each [state], and yet provide for the interest and safety of all.”  The Constitution therefore required the states to give up at least some of their previous sovereignty.

When another delegate had made the same claim about the impossibility of divided sovereignty, Hamilton replied: “This is curious sophistry.” That principle is true, he said, only when they are trying to rule over the same objects, and that was not the case with the United States Constitution. “The laws of the United States are supreme, as to all their proper, constitutional objects: the laws of the states are supreme in the same way.” Every imaginable power—except those that the Constitution delegated to the federal government and except those that it denied to the states (like printing paper money and impairing the obligations of contracts)—would be exercised by the sovereign power of the states.

When introducing what would later become the 10th Amendment in his initial proposal to the First Congress, he said:  Perhaps other words may define this more precisely than the whole of the instrument now does. I admit they may be deemed unnecessary; but there can be no harm in making such a declaration, if gentlemen will allow that the fact is as stated. I am sure I understand it so, and do therefore propose it.  His proposal might have successfully relieved the anxieties of all of the Antifederalists, if he had included all the words that they had asked for.

And under Article VI of the Constitution, state judges are required to recognize the supremacy of every federal law made in pursuance of the Constitution, regardless of any state law that may conflict with it. The Supreme Court officially recognized this power in 1803, in Marbury v. Madison.

However, two cases during the 1990s resurrected the 10th Amendment as a direct limitation on the power to regulate interstate commerce. These cases were a slight reversal of the prevailing trend in the 20th century that had given very expansive interpretations to the commerce clause. In New York v. United States (1990) a federal statute attempted to force states to adopt federal regulations for the disposal of low-level nuclear waste within their states by mandating that they accept ownership of such waste if they failed to implement the regulations. The Court struck down the relevant part of the federal statute, saying:  The take title provision appears to be unique. No other federal statute has been cited which offers a state government no option other than that of implementing legislation enacted by Congress. Whether one views the take title provision as lying outside Congress' enumerated powers, or as infringing upon the core of state sovereignty reserved by the 10th Amendment, the provision is inconsistent with the federal structure of our Government established by the Constitution.

Its subsequent influence on federal, state, and court actions is, however, debatable. When questions about the legitimate powers of the federal government are raised, they are rarely couched in 10th Amendment terms. Indeed, nearly everyone today would agree that it is a “truism” that whatever powers are not granted are reserved. But just how expansively or narrowly should those granted powers be interpreted? An excessively broad interpretation would effectively place no limits on federal authority at all. An excessively narrow interpretation would limit Congress only to those powers which were explicitly named in the enumerated powers—something James Madison argued would bring the exercise of any power to a standstill. The 10th Amendment, alas, provides no guidance for how to interpret the powers that were delegated.
