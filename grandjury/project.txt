Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, writing his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833, stated that “the grand jury may consist of any number, not less than twelve, nor more than twenty-three.” Our modern grand juries usually consist of 23 citizens. But in any case, it takes only a majority, or 12 votes, for a grand jury to deliver an indictment. By contrast, the unanimous voice of 12 jurors is typically required for conviction in a criminal trial.   The grand jury only hears from the prosecutor. Its proceedings are secret. The accused and his counsel for defense are not even present. In light of all this, and because a bare majority is sufficient for an indictment, it is not surprising that a grand jury usually decides in favor of the prosecutor. Indeed, former New York Court of Appeals Chief Judge Sol Wachtler is widely credited with coining the famous statement that a good prosecutor can convince a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich. While that may be a bit of an exaggeration, it is true that grand jury proceedings are so heavily weighted in favor of the prosecution that many suspects today choose to waive their right to a grand jury and proceed directly to the petit jury of an ordinary criminal trial.

In 1984, Bernard Goetz shot four teenagers on the New York City subway, allegedly in self-defense. The first grand jury that heard the case refused to indict him for attempted murder. New York’s district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, citing additional evidence, brought the case before the grand jury a second time (the double jeopardy clause of the 5th Amendment does not apply to grand juries). The second grand jury returned an indictment. But at his criminal trial, Goetz was found not guilty, which was something of a vindication for the first grand jury.  Unlike most of the guarantees in the Bill of Rights, the grand jury requirement has never been incorporated against the states. In 2012 there was controversy when a Florida prosecutor filed charges against George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin without seeking a grand jury indictment. But states have differing rules about grand juries, and the state of Florida requires them only in capital crimes.   But even if the grand jury is rarely called upon to fulfill one of its original purposes (as described by Justice Story) of protecting “citizens against vindictive prosecutions,” it still performs another important function. An indictment clarifies the particulars of the accusation, “so that the party may have full notice of the charge, and be able to make his defence with all reasonable knowledge and ability.” In the words of Blackstone, the combination of a grand jury indictment and a petit jury trial provides a “strong and twofold barrier . . . between the liberties of the people, and the prerogative of the crown.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_495","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_495","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_764","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_764","title":"George Zimmerman ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_710","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_710","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_714","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_714","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_501","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_501","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_519","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_519","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_520","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_520","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Hint_Caption_5","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Hint_Caption_5","title":"The clause in the 5th Amendment that specifies that a person cannot “be twice in jeopardy of life or limb” for the same offense.

The principle of double jeopardy was so well established at the time of the American Founding that this provision sparked very little debate when it was considered in the House. The only real objection to the clause was that it might be misconstrued to the detriment of the prisoner. The principle of double jeopardy, after all, was meant as a limitation on the prosecutor.

It also does not protect him from being tried more than once for the same offense if it falls under the jurisdiction of more than one state.   Although the language of the double jeopardy clause would seem to be absolute, there are several reasons why a case may legitimately be retried. If a defendant appeals, and his conviction is overturned on any grounds other than insufficient evidence, then the case may be retried. If the defendant requests a mistrial before the jury has issued a verdict, and the trial is halted because of his request, then the case can be tried again. And if there is a “hung jury” (where they cannot reach a unanimous decision), or if there is “manifest necessity” for ending a trial before a verdict can be rendered, then a case can be retried.  Moreover, while the Double Jeopardy Clause protects the defendant from being tried for the same offense under a different name, it does not protect someone who has been convicted of assault and battery from later being charged with murder if his victim dies from his wounds after the first conviction.

Many people at the time the 5th Amendment was adopted argued that it was a protection against ancient abuses of the courts; in particular, it was meant to prevent the once widespread practice of extracting evidence on pain of torture. Joseph Story, in his 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution, defended its inclusion in the Bill of Rights because “it is well known, that in some countries, not only are criminals compelled to give evidence against themselves, but are subjected to the rack or torture in order to procure a confession of guilt.”  There was probably more to the reasoning behind the ban on self-incrimination, however, than simply preventing confessions extracted from torture. As one judge in an 1802 case (Respublica v. Gibbs) put it: “It is considered cruel and unjust to propose questions which may tend to criminate the party.” Such questioning, if it were compulsory, would leave the guilty party with only two choices, both of which would be extremely undesirable. Either he can tell the truth (which might lead to civil punishments) or he can swear falsely (which might lead to everlasting perdition). A humane government, it was thought, would not place any person, even one who was guilty, on the horns of that dilemma.

Several early state constitutions had protections against self-incrimination, and several states recommended that the clause be added to the United States Constitution.

Most juries, therefore, heard statements that had been made by the defendant, even if he chose not to testify under oath.

They told him that if he did confess his crime, then he would immediately be provided with food and other comforts, his friends would stand by him, and any jury would probably show compassion and pardon him. He was also told that he would be without hope of mercy if he was convicted without a confession, and they showed him the “dungeon” that he could expect to inhabit.  After two days of this treatment, the boy confessed. The Court ruled that if there was even a chance that the confession was coerced (especially in the case of a child) then it must be ruled inadmissible. The boy was acquitted in spite of his confession and some circumstantial evidence tying him to the crime.

Another practical problem arises from the right against self-incrimination: it can be a real hindrance to the police. Often, the very witnesses who are most likely to know “who done it” are themselves implicated in the crime. For this reason, prosecutors have long been willing to grant immunity from prosecution to some suspects in exchange for their unreserved testimony about other suspects. Statutes allowing immunity were first enacted in England in the early 18th century, and they were soon adopted in the colonies. Immunity statutes were adopted for federal courts in the second half of the 19th century.  The self-incrimination protection was applied to state courts in Malloy v. Hogan in 1964. In 1966, in a case with arguably even greater significance, the Court decided in Miranda v. Arizona that testimony acquired from police interrogation could not be used in court unless police first “inform accused persons of their right of silence” as well as other rights. Suspects must knowingly waive their right to remain silent before their testimony is deemed admissible in court. The necessity of reading every suspect his “Miranda rights” means that every person is now protected from compulsory self-incrimination even before he becomes a defendant in a criminal trial.

He did not believe that the consequences of this interpretation—the possibility that an innocent man would not be afforded the opportunity to prove his innocence after an improper conviction—would be as dreadful as anticipated. In those rare cases where a trial might produce a wrongful conviction, the prisoner might appeal to the executive “for a pardon or mitigation of the sentence.”   Although Joseph Story’s constitutional opinions have generally been well respected, and although his literalist approach in this case did indeed have a basis in English precedence, his interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause has never been widely accepted in this country. Another Supreme Court justice pointed out that, if this clause were interpreted in such a way that a second trial could be refused to a prisoner who wanted one, then the double jeopardy protection would mean guaranteeing “to him the right of being hung, to protect him from the danger of a second trial.” Today it is well settled that the clause is meant to bar only the prosecutor from seeking a second trial.

The expression, according to Chief Justice Spencer in People v. Goodwin (1820), must therefore refer to “the nature of the offense,” and designate “offenses which, in former ages, were punishable by dismemberment.” In other words, the Double Jeopardy Clause was meant to refer to felonies.
