In such cases, a prosecutor, if he wishes to proceed with his case, will have to submit a new indictment.

In theory, a secret trial could be just as fair as a public trial. But as noted by Justice Harlan, writing in Estes v. Texas (1965): “the public-trial guarantee embodies a view of human nature, true as a general rule, that judges, lawyers, witnesses, and jurors will perform their respective functions more responsibly in an open court than in secret proceedings.”  The benefits to be gained by a speedy and public trial were uncontroversial to early Americans. During the ratification process of the Constitution, Virginia had requested that an amendment be added that would ensure a “fair and speedy trial,” and New York had recommended guarantees for “speedy, public” criminal trials. Madison’s original proposal for a Bill of Rights included “the right to a speedy and public trial.” The First Congress did not need to debate the desirability of this provision, and it was ultimately adopted into the 6th Amendment in the exact language that Madison had proposed.

North Carolina (1967). The federal Speedy Trial Act of 1974 attempted to define more precisely what a “speedy trial” should mean. In most cases, when a suspect is arrested, the prosecutor has 30 days to file an indictment, and the trial should take place within 70 days of the date the indictment has been filed. The clock begins ticking, therefore, the moment the accused is under restraint.  As noted above, these limitations are meant to ensure that the suspect is not detained longer than necessary before obtaining a judgment about his guilt or innocence. But there is another reason why a speedy trial is desirable: lengthy delays in judicial proceedings may impair the evidence. Over time, the memories of witnesses fade, and some witnesses may even die, putting the defendant at a disadvantage. These concerns are normally addressed by statutes of limitations, which are general rules determined by the legislature. But the courts may decide that these considerations are particularly relevant in certain cases. If a judge decides that a defendant’s right to a speedy trial has been violated, he or she may dismiss an indictment or even overturn a conviction.

Although this right is meant primarily as a protection for the accused, there is also a benefit to the public: the judiciary is a part of our government, and its operation should be open for all to see. Indeed, the press and the public may generally demand access to trials as part of their right to receive information pursuant to the 1st Amendment. Consequently, a defendant might not be able to exclude the public from a trial even if he would prefer to do so.  For a trial to qualify as public, it must be open to spectators. But the 6th Amendment does not mandate that the general public must always have easy access to a particular trial. Courtrooms are only so big, and sometimes, as during the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, there are many more people who want to watch than there are places to put them. Moreover, the courts, as co-equal branches of government, have great control over their own proceedings, which must be orderly and fair in order to satisfy the requirements of due process. Therefore, while reporters are almost always allowed in courtrooms, most courts prohibit public broadcasting of their trials. There are also some exceptions to the right to a public trial. If parts of a trial involve state secrets, or if making known a witness’s identity would put him in danger, then portions of a trial may be held in secret.

No one at the Constitutional Convention would have doubted its value. Indeed, the Framers did not wait for a bill of rights to include a jury trial provision in the Constitution. Without much debate, they added these words to Article III, Section 2:  The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.

The Declaration of Independence likewise accused the King, not only of “depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury,” but also of “transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses.” Americans at this time were therefore very touchy on this point, and several of the first state constitutions had guaranteed to the accused a jury that was “of his vicinage” or “of the country” or “in the county” where the crime was committed.

According to a letter by Madison, many Senators had believed that the “vicinage” requirement was “either too vague or too strict a term.” Different states had different notions about how broad an area could be encompassed by the “vicinage” of a crime. Besides, Congress was already in the process of crafting a Judiciary Bill which would largely address this problem, albeit not constitutionally. The Senate chose to strike the language altogether. If they had gotten their way, then what would ultimately become the 6th Amendment would have made no mention of juries at all.    Although the Senate had struck out many other amendments proposed by the House without creating any backlash, this jury trial provision was important enough that the House resisted the Senate’s attempts to delete it. A reconciliation committee between the two Houses adopted the final language of the 6th Amendment: “the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law.” This language was precise enough to quiet the fears of many of the Antifederalists, but it was broad enough to allow some discretion to Congress.

During the ratification debates, delegates from North Carolina, Virginia, and Massachusetts all argued on behalf of local juries precisely because they would have already formed opinions about the crime and the accused. “The very intention of the trial by jury,” according to Joseph McDowall of North Carolina, “is, that the accused may be tried by persons who come from the vicinage or neighborhood, who may be acquainted with his character.”  Abraham Holmes of Massachusetts had objected to the wording of the Constitution because it did not adequately provide for “a right to a trial as free and impartial as the lot of humanity will admit of.” But in the next breath he ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_754","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_754","title":"insisted that local juries were imperative, because only they “have an opportunity to form a judgment of the character of the person charged with the crime, and also to judge of the credibility of the witnesses.” But do prior judgments about the suspect and witnesses in a case destroy the jury’s impartiality?  Many other delegates believed they did. Governor Samuel Johnston of North Carolina criticized the prevailing practice of Virginia, which often summoned its juries “from the by-standers.” He suggested that the provisions of the unamended Constitution might have some advantages: “We may expect less partiality when the trial is by strangers; and were I to be tried for my property or life, I would rather be tried by disinterested men, who were not biased, than by men who were perhaps intimate friends of my opponent.” Christopher Gore of Massachusetts likewise disagreed with his colleague’s wish to provide for juries that would know the “character of the person charged with the crime.” He pointed out that “knowing the character and circumstances of the party in trial” would not always be “promotive of justice.” In fact, it would be better if “the jury could be perfectly ignorant of the person in trial”; for whenever a “jury judge from any other circumstances but what are part of the cause in question, they are not impartial.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_537","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_537","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_538","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_538","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide48631","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Local and Impartial?","thumbnail":"dr/Slide48631_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si48665","Text_Caption_752","Text_Caption_753","Text_Caption_754"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide48631"}}},{"id":"si48752","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si48754","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_242","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_242","title":"Speedy and Public Trial, Impartial Jury, and Accusations ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_140","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_140","title":"Guaranteeing an Impartial Jury ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_755","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_755","title":"From 1807 to Today ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_756","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_756","title":"Since the adoption of the 6th Amendment, the courts have leaned in the direction of desiring impartiality in its jurors over the benefits of prior knowledge of the principals’ characters.

Burr (1807), Chief Justice John Marshall declared: “Were it possible to obtain a jury without any prepossessions whatever respecting the guilt or innocence of the accused, it would be extremely desirable to obtain such a jury; but this is perhaps impossible, and therefore will not be required.” A juror who had previously advanced opinions about the prisoner’s guilt on material points of the charge, however, “is good cause of challenge.”    Today, if a defendant argues that a local jury would be biased—perhaps influenced by media coverage about his case, for example—then a judge may decide that the 6th Amendment requires a change of venue to seat a more impartial jury. In addition, current interpretations of the 6th Amendment have stressed that it is not only important to select individual jurors who have no previous biases about the case, but that juries, to be truly impartial, must be representative of society as a whole. Juries at the time of the Founding were almost always comprised of white, property-owning men. Today, courts require that juries be more inclusive.

Several state constitutions had included guarantees that were similar to the one found in Virginia’s Declaration of Rights: “That in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation.” The wording may have changed slightly between states, but its meaning was always clear: the state could not lock up a person without explaining why—abusing this principle has been the privilege of tyrants throughout history.

The 6th Amendment right of a suspect “to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation” is closely tied to at least three of the protections found in the 5th Amendment. It is the job of the grand jury, after all, to specify (or “inform”) in an indictment what are the particular charges against the accused. And this indictment is also necessary for ensuring that the accused shall not “be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” Unless the prosecutor is compelled to be specific about the charges against a suspect before he is brought to trial, there would be no way to test whether a suspect was being subjected to “double jeopardy” for the same offense. Finally, this provision enables the prisoner to guard against self-incrimination. If a defendant knows the nature and cause of the accusation, then he will be a better judge of the purpose of any questions that the police or the prosecutor might ask.
