This concept was, and is, called “eminent domain,” and it was brought over the Atlantic by British colonists.  In the United States, the “sovereign” is, collectively, our state and federal governments. It may seem odd, at first, to think that one of those governments can take our property away from us without our consent, but it is actually a common-sense proposition: how else is a government to build a road, or a canal, or a post office? You might think that the government should purchase the property, and that is, in fact, what the government typically does. But what if a property owner refuses to sell? What if he demands a price that is so high that paying it would make the whole project fail? (“You want my house? Okay, Uncle Sam, I’ll give it to ya—for a billion bucks! And you pay the closing costs!”) Should a single property owner be able to prevent the construction of an airport, an interstate highway, or a military base that would benefit thousands or even millions of his fellow citizens?   The Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment does not create eminent domain in the United States. Rather, it assumes the existence of eminent domain and then places some important conditions upon it: private property may only be taken for “public use,” and when the government does so the government must pay “just compensation” to the property owner. In practice, this typically means that when a government decides that it needs certain property—typically real estate, rather than personal property—it first tries to purchase the property, and when that fails, it “takes” the property through a process called “condemnation,” during which a court determines the property’s fair market value, which the government must then pay to the property owner.

The first court case to confirm that scope related to the Takings Clause. In Barron v. Baltimore (1833), the plaintiff contended that the city of Baltimore had, through its policies, destroyed the value of his wharf, and under the 5th Amendment, he sought “just compensation.” Chief Justice Marshall wrote that the 5th Amendment, like all of the rights named in the Bill of Rights, had always been “intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the government of the United States, and is not applicable to the legislation of the states.” This left each state to decide for itself how many limitations to place on its government through its own constitution. So if Maryland chose not to include an eminent domain restriction in its constitution, then injured parties could not look to the U.S. Constitution for relief.  For a long time, there were very few federal court cases relating to eminent domain, and so the state courts decided the most controversial and important cases, without any reference to the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment. The history of these cases tends to favor the sovereignty of the government over the property claims of private individuals. States were frequently permitted to pay less than fair market value for the property they seized.

In Davidson v. City of New Orleans (1878), the Court pointed out that if eminent domain were a part of the “due process of law,” then the Framers of the Bill of Rights would not have had to add it separately in the 5th Amendment. The fact that the 14th Amendment had a “due process” clause but not a “takings” clause seemed to suggest that the latter was never meant to be applied to the states. It did not take long for the Court to change its mind. In 1897, the Court incorporated the Takings Clause into the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment in Chicago, Burlington & Quincey Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago. Thus, the Takings Clause applies equally today to both the state and federal governments.  Some modern governmental policies, such as environmental protection regulations or historic landmark ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_763","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_763","title":"designations, can diminish an owner’s ability to use his own property and decrease its resale value. Cases such as these have become the most common ones relating to eminent domain, and the courts try to balance a number of factors—relating both to the owners’ rights and the government’s needs—when deciding what constitutes “just compensation.”  In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has placed some important limitations on the way that eminent domain is exercised. For example, it has not allowed cities to make zoning permits conditional on the owner relinquishing a part of his property. In one case, a state governmental agency would not grant a building permit unless the owner provided a beach easement on his property [Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987)], and in another case, a city agency demanded a bike path from an owner in exchange for a permit to expand an office building [Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994)]. In both cases, the Court held that the government was attempting to take property without “just compensation.” Thus, while government agencies may attach conditions to their grants of permits, the conditions must be connected to some legitimate government interest that arises out of the activity being regulated—they cannot simply amount to land grabs.

After all, it looks more like it’s about asserting government powers (its power to “take” the property of private individuals) rather than about protecting individual rights. But in fact, statesmen and political thinkers had assumed for a long time that the sovereign authority in the government had this power of “eminent domain” (the government’s authority to appropriate private property when the good of the whole requires it). The 5th Amendment does not therefore “grant” that power to the government. What the Takings Clause does is place certain limitations on that power, limitations that protect individual property rights. When the government must take private property, it can only do so “for public use,” and it must offer the property owner “just compensation.” Of course, both of those limitations are capable of more than one interpretation, and that’s where the potential for controversy lies.

Therefore, when it became necessary to take private property for public use, the state was obliged to compensate “those who are injured by” the confiscation. He suggested that it was enough that the state “can oblige a citizen to sell his inheritance”; it would be overreaching if the state could do so without paying for it.   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story later explained in his 1833 Commentaries that the Takings Clause had as its basis both natural equity and traditional common law:       This is an affirmance of a great doctrine established by the common law, for the protection of private      property. It is founded in natural equity, and is laid down by jurists as a principle of universal law. Indeed, in a      free government, almost all other rights would become utterly worthless, if the government possessed an      uncontrollable power over the private fortune of every citizen.

TRPA placed a moratorium on the construction on individual homes in the Basin. A group of landowners prevented from building in the Basin by the ban sued on the grounds that such a prohibition constituted a taking under the 5th Amendment because they were prevented from using their land. They alleged that TRPA had violated the 5th Amendment by not compensating them for their land.   The opinion of the Court,​ written by​ Justice John Paul Stevens​, ​found​ ​that the moratorium did not constitute a taking, identifying​ ​an inherent difference between the acquisition o​f ​property for public use and the regulation of property from private use​.​ T​he moratorium at issue in this case ​​was​ ​as a regulation of property from private use and therefore no compensation was required.
