The Federalists argued that a bill of rights was not only unnecessary, but that it might even be dangerous.  According to the Federalists, the new national government created by the United States Constitution was meant to be one of enumerated powers, unable to exercise any power that was not named in that document. A bill of rights, however, might be interpreted to imply that the national government could exercise any power that was not explicitly excluded. A bill of rights might also be interpreted as being a complete, exclusive list of individual rights, and might therefore have the perverse effect of limiting individual rights to those defined in the bill itself. But most Antifederalists were not persuaded by these concerns, and so the Constitution was ratified with a tacit understanding that Congress would propose a bill of rights without delay.  The 9th Amendment was meant to address both Federalist concerns about a bill of rights. First, it was designed to negate any suggestion that such a list implied that the national government possessed any additional, unenumerated powers. Second, the 9th Amendment was designed to clarify that the Bill of Rights is not exhaustive—it does not name every conceivable individual right. Other individual rights might very well exist. But this aspect of the 9th Amendment presents at least two additional questions. What are those other rights, if any? And who has the power to identify and define them?

In other words, the people should decide how to frame the laws under which they themselves should live. This principle had been first articulated by John Locke. Of all of man’s natural rights, Locke was particularly insistent that property rights could not be restricted without the consent of the people. Taxes could not be levied by any government without a person’s “own consent, i.e. the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them.” This principle that taxes could only be levied with the people’s consent, derived from Locke, was repeated in the familiar rallying cry at the time of the Revolution: “no taxation without representation!”  But Americans had also expanded Locke’s principles beyond the rights of property. They believed that natural rights—to life, liberty, or property—could not be curtailed without the consent of the governed. This principle was eloquently expressed in the Declaration of Independence: “all men . . . are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights . . . That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_591","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_591","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_592","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_592","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_911","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_911","title":"Independence Day 1931 ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_797","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_797","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_912","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_912","title":"Drafting the Declaration of Independence ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_798","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_798","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_614","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_614","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_804","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_804","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_805","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_805","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_615","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_615","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_622","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_622","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide55494","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Consent of the Governed as a Protection of Rights","thumbnail":"dr/Slide55494_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si55528","si55530","Text_Caption_887","Text_Caption_888","Text_Caption_911","Image_797","Text_Caption_912","Image_798","Image_804","Image_805"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide55494"}}},{"id":"si55654","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si55656","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_292","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_292","title":"The 9th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_182","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_182","title":"Bills of Rights as a Protection of Rights ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_890","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_890","title":" ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_790","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_790","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_891","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_891","title":"Yet the Anglo-American political tradition found that popular government was often not enough to protect the rights of individuals because majorities could act just as tyrannically as single despots. It was discovered that placing some restrictions on popular consent was in everybody’s best interests; therefore, declarations or bills of rights were established. Blackstone explained that a bill of rights was intended to name certain facets “of natural liberty, which is not required by the laws of society to be sacrificed to public convenience.” There are some liberties that are so fundamental that the state is almost never justified in taking them away. For instance, very few interests of government can be deemed more important than an individual’s natural right to exercise his religion in the manner he deems proper. And although free speech can sometimes be harmful to society, the benefits of this right are generally considered to be more important than its harms. The rights that are listed in a bill of rights are therefore intended to be exceptions to the general grant of power given to the people’s representatives.

This fear—one that Madison himself had expressed in the Virginia Convention—was, he said, “one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard urged against the admission of a bill of rights into this system.” But he went on to say that one of his proposed amendments—what would become the 9th Amendment—could prevent that misinterpretation of the Bill of Rights.

Connecticut, the Court referred to the 9th Amendment, among several others, in its opinion. Justice Goldberg wrote a concurring opinion in which he contended that “the right of privacy in the marital relation is fundamental and basic—a personal right ‘retained by the people’ within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment.”   Justice Black, in his dissent, argued that, “as every student of history knows,” the 9th Amendment “was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication.” Therefore, any power to strike down state laws because they offend rights that go unnamed in the Bill of Rights “was not given by the Framers, but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court.” The 9th Amendment was conceived as a way to limit federal powers; therefore, its use by the Court in this decision—which limited a state government’s powers—was ironic, to say the least.  Justice Black said more: “Use of any such broad, unbounded judicial authority would make of this Court’s members a day-to-day constitutional convention.” Justice Stewart, in a separate dissent, likewise criticized the Court’s use of this amendment: “to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_603","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_603","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_604","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_604","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_927","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_927","title":"Justice Hugo Black ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_827","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_827","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_928","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_928","title":"Justice Potter Stewart ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_829","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_829","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_835","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_835","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_836","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_836","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_625","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_625","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_626","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_626","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide56008","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Grisworld v.

Nonetheless, once justices began to speculate on retained rights, they opened up a floodgate of possibilities. Justice Douglas, in his 1971 dissent of Palmer v. Thompson, noted that other modern constitutions from other nations included rights such as “the right of the people to education or to work or to recreation by swimming or otherwise.” It seemed reasonable to infer that these too might “be rights ‘retained by the people’” under the 9th Amendment. The Court in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), relying in general on the privacy right established by Griswold, struck down state laws against sodomy. And perhaps most famously, the Court concluded in Roe v. Wade (1973) that “this right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_605","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_605","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_606","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_606","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_933","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_933","title":"Privacy, Abortion, and the 9th Amendment ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_838","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_838","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_845","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_845","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_629","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_629","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide56088","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Applying the 9th Amendment","thumbnail":"dr/Slide56088_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si56122","si56124","Text_Caption_903","Text_Caption_904","Text_Caption_933","Image_838","Image_845"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide56088"}}},{"id":"si56202","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si56204","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_299","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_299","title":"The 9th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_189","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_189","title":"Applying the 9th Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_905","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_905","title":"Controversy Over the Court’s Authority to Uphold Individual Rights ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_906","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_906","title":"The constitutional controversies surrounding these decisions (as opposed to the moral or political ones) concern whether or not the courts have the authority to uphold individual rights that are not named in the Bill of Rights and to forbid an exercise of state power that is not forbidden by the Constitution.

Justice Stewart, in his Griswold dissent, exclaimed that he thought Connecticut’s ban of contraceptives was “an uncommonly silly law.” And Justice Thomas repeated those words in regard to sodomy laws in his dissent of Lawrence. Both believed, however, that not all silly state laws are unconstitutional. And the courts should be limited in their exercise of judicial review.   It may be asked: if the courts do not protect individuals from a ridiculous state law, then who will? To that question, Justice Stewart responded that “the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal [the state’s ban on contraceptives].” In other words, the power to define and protect the rights “retained by the people” was intended to be exercised by the people themselves. The 9th Amendment had been custom-tailored for a constitution that, in the words of Madison’s Federalist No. 45, possessed “few and defined” powers.
