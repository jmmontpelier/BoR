In fact, there was so little disagreement on these three provisions that there was barely a hiccup from the time James Madison initially proposed them until their ultimate ratification by the states. While some of the interpretations for these provisions have expanded over time, their essential purpose has remained the same: they help to ensure that defendants in a criminal trial are given a fair opportunity to mount an effective defense.

The American colonists were very protective of this right, largely because the British had denied it to them. Once the British discovered that they could not win a conviction from local juries when American defendants violated unpopular laws, they started bringing criminal cases in Courts of Admiralty. These courts allowed interrogatories (written questions) and the secret examination of witnesses. John Adams defended John Hancock in one such trial, and the use of such unfair procedures became one of the rallying cries for revolution. Consequently, several of the first state constitutions specifically protected the right of a criminal defendant to be confronted by the witnesses against him.

One continuing controversy has been whether “hearsay evidence” is permissible in criminal trials. If a witness claims in court that he heard a third party say something incriminating about the defendant—and the third party is not (and perhaps cannot be) called to the witness stand to be cross-examined by the defense—does that violate the 6th Amendment right to be confronted by one’s accusers?

A 1980 case, Ohio v. Roberts had concluded that hearsay evidence could be admissible if it was deemed reliable. But in a 2004 case, Crawford v. Washington, the Court overturned Roberts, deciding unanimously that hearsay testimony (in this case, a tape-recorded statement to the police) may not be admitted.  The courts will sometimes make exceptions to the Confrontation Clause under extraordinary circumstances. For instance, in Maryland v. Craig (1990), a child witness was allowed to testify through closed-circuit television because testifying in court would have been too traumatic for the child. In this case, the Court determined that all of the criteria which make the Confrontation Clause valuable to the defendant were met: the jury was able to view the “manner of delivery” as the child testified, and the defense was able to cross-examine the witness. The courts will grant some exceptions, such as this one, but they must be for a good cause and they must not compromise the protections intended by the 6th Amendment.

Use of such force, through a court order called a “subpoena,” is often necessary, because witnesses are often reluctant to testify, for a variety of reasons. Sometimes witnesses are afraid; more commonly, they are simply reluctant to miss a day or more of work. A subpoena usually overcomes their reluctance.  The idea of calling witnesses seems so basic to us today that it seems hard to believe that, for much of British history, those who were accused of treason or felonies were not permitted to call witnesses in their own defense.

Blackstone explained that “the courts grew so heartily ashamed of a doctrine so unreasonable and oppressive, that a practice was gradually introduced of examining witnesses for the prisoner, but not upon oath: the consequence of which still was, that the jury gave less credit to the prisoner’s evidence, than to that produced by the crown.” At last, primarily through the efforts of the House of Commons, it was established that all defendants “shall have the same compulsive process to bring in his witnesses for him, as was usual to compel their appearance against him.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_553","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_553","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_554","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_554","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_582","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_582","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_583","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_583","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Hint_Caption_7","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Hint_Caption_7","title":"The process of using the subpoena power of the court to compel witnesses to testify.

He concludes that the ancient practice was “a reproach to the criminal jurisprudence of England”; and, as a consequence, “they are crimsoned with the blood of persons, who were condemned to death, not only against law, but against the clearest rules of evidence.”  Nonetheless, the same abuses could be found in many American colonial courts during the same period. But some colonies reversed course at roughly the same time that England did. By 1701, Delaware’s Charter already guaranteed “[t]hat all Criminals shall have the same Privileges of Witnesses and Council as their Prosecutors.” And by the time that the states were writing their first constitutions, this right was widely recognized and protected. The 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights ensured that “in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right...to call for evidence in his favor.” Vermont’s Constitution of 1777 used very similar language to Virginia’s. Delaware’s Declaration of Rights went further than merely recognizing the right “to call for evidence in his favor”; it guaranteed that the accused had a right “to examine Evidence on Oath in his Favour.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_555","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_555","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_556","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_556","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_817","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_817","title":"Alger Hiss Subpoena ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_765","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_765","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_769","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_769","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_828","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_828","title":"Virginia Declaration of Rights on ConText ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_782","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_782","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_783","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_783","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_829","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_829","title":"1777 Constitution of Vermont on ConText ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_784","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_784","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_785","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_785","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_574","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_574","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_586","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_586","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_587","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_587","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide51195","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Right to Compel Witnesses","thumbnail":"dr/Slide51195_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si51229","si51231","Text_Caption_794","Text_Caption_795","Text_Caption_817","Image_765","Image_769","Text_Caption_828","Image_782","Image_783","Text_Caption_829","Image_784","Image_785"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide51195"}}},{"id":"si54102","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si54104","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_257","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_257","title":" Witnesses and Counsel in Criminal Trials ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_149","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_149","title":"The Right to Compel Witnesses ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_797","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_797","title":"During the ratifying period, both Virginia and North Carolina had requested that the United States Constitution be amended to ensure that the accused had the right “to call for evidence.” New York had wanted even stronger language, specifying that the accused “ought...to have the means of producing his Witnesses.” Madison’s proposal to the First Congress borrowed more from Blackstone than from the state ratifying conventions, and therefore it contained language that was even more robust.

Texas (1967). This case struck down a Texas statute that barred anyone who was implicated in the same crime as the defendant from being called as a witness for the defendant (although prosecutors could call them as witnesses). The Court held that the 6th Amendment “right to offer the testimony of witnesses, and to compel their attendance, if necessary, is in plain terms the right to present a defense, the right to present the defendant’s version of the facts as well as the prosecution’s to the jury so it may decide where the truth lies.” Texas had argued that its statute was necessary because witnesses who were implicated in the same crime as the accused were untrustworthy. The Court decided that it was a violation of the 6th Amendment for any state to enforce “arbitrary rules that prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying.”   Certain exceptions to compulsory testimony have always been recognized. No witness can be forced to give testimony that incriminates himself, for instance, and usually a person is given immunity from testifying against his or her spouse. Certain professions, such as priests and doctors, can claim a confidentiality privilege, but this privilege is not extended to all professions. In one early Pennsylvania case, Holmes v.

This was one “settled rule” in English common law that Blackstone vehemently criticized.

But Delaware’s Charter of 1701 went further, declaring: “That all Criminals shall have the same Privileges of Witnesses and Council as their Prosecutors.”  By the time America had declared independence, other states had likewise abandoned England’s “odious” precedent. Delaware’s 1776 Declaration of Rights guaranteed that “in all Prosecutions for criminal Offenses, every Man hath a Right...to be allowed Counsel.” And Vermont’s Constitution of 1777 declared that “in all prosecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard, by himself and his counsel.” During the ratification period, Virginia and North Carolina had requested that the Constitution be amended to guarantee to the accused the right to “be allowed counsel in his favor.” Madison’s proposal to the First Congress, however, adopted the wording from New York, that the accused should have “assistance of Council for his defense.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_563","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_563","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_564","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_564","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_834","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_834","title":"Body of Liberties  on ConText ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_790","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_790","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_792","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_792","roles":{}},{"id":"Button_590","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_590","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Slide51529","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The RIght to Counsel in America","thumbnail":"dr/Slide51529_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si51563","si51565","Text_Caption_804","Text_Caption_805","Text_Caption_834","Image_790","Image_792"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide51529"}}},{"id":"si51689","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si51691","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_261","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_261","title":"Witnesses and Counsel in Criminal Trials ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_153","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_153","title":"The Right to Counsel Evolves ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_807","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_807","title":" ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_758","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_758","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_808","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_808","title":"The original meaning of this clause in the 6th Amendment appears to have been no more than a limitation on the power of the government: the state could not prevent the defendant from seeking the assistance of legal counsel during a criminal trial.

Throughout the 19th century, however, defense attorneys became increasingly the norm for all but the poorest defendants.

In Johnson v. Zerbst (1938), the Court held that the 6th Amendment required that all defendants who could not afford lawyers be offered court-appointed ones.

Wainwright, incorporated this newer understanding of the 6th Amendment’s right to “have the assistance of counsel” into the 14th Amendment, so that it henceforth applied to the states. Gideon essentially adopted the standard of Zerbst, that courts may not “deprive an accused of his life or liberty unless he has or waives the assistance of counsel.” Gideon applied only to felonies, however; a 1973 decision, Argersinger v. Hamlin, recognized the right to counsel even in misdemeanor trials. And in a pair of cases decided in 2012 (Missouri v. Frye and Lafler v. Cooper) the Court upheld the 6th Amendment right to counsel during plea bargaining. Justice Kennedy, noting “the reality that criminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials,” determined that the 6th Amendment must adapt to that new reality.  Starting with Gideon, the Supreme Court’s interpretations of the 6th Amendment has turned the ancient restriction on a right to counsel on its head. The earliest English practice was to deny counsel in all but misdemeanor trials. Now, defendants in all criminal trials have a right to counsel except for the most petty offenses. This right is in force unless and until the defendant explicitly waives it. In fact, the Court has even held that the 6th Amendment protects its opposite: it guarantees to a defendant the right to represent himself [Faretta v. California (1975)]. And even this right to defend oneself may be denied if the court determines that the defendant is not competent to make that choice.
