Like the person on the street, a philosopher might define a “right” in any number of ways, but when constitutional scholars use it, they tend to have a particular meaning in mind: a constitutional right is the lawful authority to do something (like vote); to stop the government from doing something (like search our homes without a warrant); or even to force the government to do something (like provide legal counsel and a jury trial for a criminal defendant).

A government, whether national, state or local, has a lot of power. It needs that power to do the things governments are supposed to do, things like defending the nation from enemies, building roads, or even collecting trash. But sometimes governments misuse their powers, or at least use them in a way that prompts someone to object. In most cases, a single person cannot stop a government from, say, building a road. After all, in our system of government—the one created by the first seven articles of the Constitution—the majority generally rules. So if the government is building a road, it is doing so because a majority of the people, through their elected representatives, has decided that building that particular road is a good idea. Why should one person be able to overrule the majority?  But sometimes a single person can effectively stop the government from doing something, or at least change the way the government does it. If, for example, the government wants to build a road over your land, the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution says that it must pay you the fair market value of that property. In other words, you have a “right” to be fairly compensated. So, at the very least, you can mitigate the harm the government is causing you. It is also possible that you can stop the road from being built at all, if the government is unable or unwilling to pay you fair value for your land or to prove that the land is being taken for “public use.”  So, because of one of your 5th Amendment rights, you can stand up to even an overwhelming majority of your fellow citizens and change the way they do business, perhaps even stop them altogether.

As we shall see, these Founders had their reasons for opposing a bill of rights. But other Founders, notably George Mason and Patrick Henry, considered one to be essential; enough Founders agreed with Mason and Henry that they came close to preventing the ratification of Constitution because it lacked a bill of rights. Eventually a deal was struck: the Constitution would be ratified, and the first order of business in the First Congress would be the drafting of a bill of rights.

Its history has been one of ever-expanding rights conferred upon an ever-expanding class of citizenry. Understanding how England’s Bill of Rights developed is necessary for understanding why there was a controversy over whether or not to add a bill of rights to the United States Constitution. Both the defenders and the detractors of that proposal drew upon the English tradition to support their positions. The staunchest defenders of an American bill of rights could rightly claim that the English counterpart had been an invaluable security for the rights of both Englishmen and Americans. The opponents of a bill of rights, however, could rightly claim that the political conditions that made a bill of rights necessary in England were very different from the limited and wholly popular government that the American Constitution formed.  Alexander Hamilton, in the very first paragraph of the first Federalist essay, observed that America’s recent experiments in constitutional government made it seem as though history had left it to this people “to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_55","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_55","title":"Study at the Home of the  Father of the Constitution ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_56","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_56","title":"The Center for the Constitution offers high quality constitutional education for teachers, journalists, elected officials, law enforcement, judges, international visitors, business executives, and the general public.
