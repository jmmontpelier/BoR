For the Framers of the 2nd Amendment, however, probably the most pressing question addressed in this amendment was what would be “necessary to the security of a free State,” with the word “free” receiving even more emphasis than the word “security.”    From these standpoints many questions arise: Is the 2nd Amendment only meant to protect state militias? Is it outdated and essentially meaningless in modern society? Or is it also meant to protect an individual’s rights? Does it remain as important in the 21st century as it was in the 18th? And are the Framers’ original goals still relevant? Is it still important to arm citizens against the possibility of a tyrannical government?   For more than 200 years, these 2nd Amendment questions largely lay dormant. Then, in two recent decisions, one from 2008 (District of Columbia v. Heller) and one from 2010 (McDonald v. City of Chicago), the United States Supreme Court ruled that the 2nd Amendment is not just about militias; it protects an individual’s right “to keep and bear arms.” Together, these cases are generally perceived as a decisive victory for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other supporters of “gun rights.” But the Court decided both cases by the barest of margins: five votes to four. And as so often occurs, the Supreme Court’s decisions created as many issues as they resolved.

In John Locke’s Second Treatise, he considers it almost self-evident that “I should have a right to destroy that which threatens me with destruction,” and he calls the precept a “fundamental law of nature.” In the state of nature, this right may take the form of wielding a rock or a stick against a single adversary, but in civil society the right of self-defense takes different forms. The primary change that takes place in civil society is that, under most circumstances, the right to punish an aggressor is taken out of the hands of the individual and reserved to the state. Only when a person is in immediate danger, and has no opportunity to seek protection from a magistrate, does he reclaim what Locke describes as his original “liberty to kill the aggressor.” Locke’s Second Treatise, however, does not extrapolate from this natural right of self-defense to any political teaching on the arms that a citizen may or may not keep for this purpose.  Still, these arguments from Locke could be interpreted to justify the right to keep and bear arms—as a political extension of a people’s original right of self-defense—and many Americans did interpret that right in this way.

As early as 1689 the English Bill of Rights had guaranteed that the King’s subjects “may have arms for their defence.” But this provision stipulated not only that this right was confined to Protestants but also that it extended only to what was “suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.” Blackstone called this right “a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation.” But these “due restrictions” could restrict the right significantly.    The English government ostensibly limited gun ownership within its borders in order to protect its game, but the reason why England disarmed her subjects outside of those borders was unquestionably to prevent insurrections. Several times throughout the 18th century, Parliament took action to disarm the Scottish and deny them a militia. The Scottish steadfastly claimed that these actions were a violation of their constitutional rights under the Treaty of Union with England. The English had already made similar and more successful attempts to disarm the Irish, particularly in the Disarming Act of 1695, but it was primarily the Scottish experience that provided a cautionary tale for Americans.

In Federalist No. 46, James Madison wrote that “the Americans possess [the advantage of being armed] over the people of almost every other nation.” When Thomas Jefferson advised his nephew on a course of study, he added that the exercise of the mind should accompany the exercise of the body: “As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind.”   These attitudes were understandable, given British attempts to restrict private gun ownership during the Revolutionary War. In 1775, General Thomas Gage tried to diffuse a volatile situation in Boston by disarming its residents. During this time the city was under occupation by British troops under Gage’s command. Many Bostonians, in light of what had recently happened in Lexington and Concord, wished only to evacuate the city. General Gage made an agreement with the town selectmen: If the residents would lodge their guns in the care of their own selectmen, then the citizens would be free to leave the town with all of their belongings, and the arms would later be returned to their owners once peace was restored. Thousands of guns were surrendered on these terms. Once they were collected, however, the general “set a guard over the arms,” denied permission to the citizenry to leave the Boston area, and then refused to return their arms. In other words, Gage broke every promise he had made.

Rumors began to circulate that the Britsh intended to disarm all of America. Only July 6, 1775, almost a year before declaring independence, the 2nd Continental Congress issued a declaration defending the colonists’ “Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms.” One prominent cause featured in this catalogue of abuses was the “open violation of honor” by General Gage in Boston, “in definance of the obligations of treaties.” Thus, the newly independent American states guarded their right to keep and bear arms.  The original understanding of the right “to keep and bear arms” that developed in early America related to the importance of a militia. But the importance of a militia—a corps of citizen-soldiers—was not primarily tied to its proficiency at defending against foreign aggression.

A militia was the way that free people defended themselves.  Other reasons were given for protecting the right to keep and bear arms. The Pennsylvania and Vermont Declaration of Rights both guaranteed “that the people have a right to bear arms for themselves and the state.” And one proposed constitutional amendment in the Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention would have extended the possible uses of this even further, declaring: “That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense of themselves and their own state, or the United States, or for the purpose of killing game.” The primary purpose for defending the right to bear arms at the time, however, was to arm the citizens against the possibility that the federal government may one day grow tyrannical.

Neither could be completely trusted to act lawfully, and each was meant to be a check on the other.  It was clear that the primary purpose for arming American citizens was to guard against possible usurpations of power by their own government. Five states requested that an amendment guaranteeing the right to bear arms be included in the new constitution. Three states requested amendments requiring a two-thirds or three-fourths vote in Congress before any standing army could be established in peacetime. And when the First Congress debated what would become the 2nd Amendment, Elbridge Gerry asked: “What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty.” Thus according to the Amendment’s drafters, the right of the people to “keep and bear arms,” as the text of the 2nd Amendment would make clear is, “necessary to the security of a free state.” ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_480","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_480","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_481","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_481","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_747","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_747","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide45269","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"The Development of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms III","thumbnail":"dr/Slide45269_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si45303","si45305","Text_Caption_690","Text_Caption_691","Image_747"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide45269"}}},{"id":"si45383","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_218","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_218","title":"The 2nd Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_125","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_125","title":"The Development of the Right to Keep and Bear Arms in America ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_692","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_692","title":"The Threat of Standing Armies ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_693","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_693","title":"The threat of standing armies, especially in peacetime, was indeed a pervasive dread during the debates over the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

And yet, one of the primary purposes of the 2nd Amendment was to guard American citizens against possible usurpations of power by their own governments. Thus, given advancements in the government’s military, is the 2nd Amendment merely a historical artifact without modern relevance?  Many gun control supporters think the right to bear arms is outmoded.

It also ignores the fundamental problem that the Framers were trying to address. The drafters of this right were trying to avoid a situation in which American citizens were too weak and submissive to oppose their government should it ever become necessary.  Joseph Story gave two reasons why the right to bear arms was considered “the palladium of the liberties of a republic.” One of them was to “enable the people to resist and triumph over” tyrants once they had taken over the government.

Miller (1939), the Court considered whether a criminal defendant had a 2nd Amendment right to possess a short-barreled shotgun despite a federal statute that outlawed possession of such weapons. The Court found no such right because the shotgun had no “reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.” Thus the Miller decision seemed to be saying that the right to keep and bear arms was at least related to potential militia service—but the wording of the ruling left its implications unclear. Lacking any better guidance, many lower federal courts relied upon Miller to hold that the 2nd Amendment could only be invoked when the question involved maintaining a militia. Indeed, some courts decided that individuals did not possess any 2nd Amendment rights unless they were already enrolled in a state militia.

Justice Antonin Scalia, delivering the opinion of the Court, concluded: “There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the 2nd Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms.” Thus the Court determined that the relevance of the 2nd Amendment did not expire with the extinction of state militias. He added that “of course the right was not unlimited...” Therefore, certain reasonable limitations on the right to keep and bear arms could be imposed.

According to Stevens, those who drafted the 2nd Amendment intended only to protect “the sovereignty of the several States,” not the individual rights of gun owners.   It was not until the 2008 Heller case, then, that the Court decided that the 2nd Amendment, like the other rights named in the first eight amendments, afforded individuals protections from federal intrusions. But Heller was only the first part of a one-two punch. Just two years later, the Court used the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment to “incorporate” that right “as against the states.” This is very significant because the most restrictive regulations on guns have historically come from state governments.

Heller case only applied to federal gun restrictions in the city of Washington, D.C. It declined to rule on the question whether the 2nd Amendment’s protection of individual gun ownership applied also to state restrictions. The question would not have been controversial in the early republic, since many state constitutions—whether drafted before or after the U.S. Bill of Rights—had included a right to bear arms in their own bills of rights. As early as 1829, William Rawle wrote that if either a state or the federal legislature were to attempt a restriction on the people’s right to bear arms, the 2nd Amendment “may be appealed to as a restraint on both.” The applicability of the amendment to state legislatures, however, was by no means widely assumed in the 19th or 20th centuries, and the Court did not decide the question until McDonald v. City of Chicago in 2010.   Justice Samuel Alito delivered the opinion of the Court in McDonald. He explained that the governing question for determining if the 2nd Amendment should be incorporated into the 14th Amendment was whether it was found to be “fundamental to the Nation’s scheme of ordered liberty” or “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” The majority of the Court decided, in another 5-4 decision, that both of these standards applied to an individual’s right to bear arms. In his dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer argued that he could “find nothing in the 2nd Amendment’s text, history, or underlying rationale that could warrant characterizing it as ‘fundamental’ insofar as it seeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for private self-defense purposes.”  ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Button_490","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_490","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Button_491","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Button_491","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"}}},{"id":"Image_750","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_750","roles":{}},{"id":"Slide45945","class":"Normal Slide","instance":"Apply to State Governments?","thumbnail":"dr/Slide45945_thnail.jpg","children":["si6543","si45979","si45981","Text_Caption_711","Text_Caption_712","Image_750"],"roles":{"slide":{"durationInFrames":18000},"navigation":{"navid":"Slide45945"}}},{"id":"si46105","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"si46107","class":"TODO::Senthil","roles":{}},{"id":"Image_682","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_682","roles":{}},{"id":"Title_AutoShape_226","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Title_AutoShape_226","title":"The 2nd Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"SubTitle_AutoShape_133","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"SubTitle_AutoShape_133","title":"The 2nd Amendment ","roles":{"click":{"subtype":"button"},"textData":{}}},{"id":"Text_Caption_714","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_714","title":" ","roles":{"textData":{}}},{"id":"Image_681","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Image_681","roles":{}},{"id":"Text_Caption_715","class":"TODO::Senthil","instance":"Text_Caption_715","title":"Between District of Columbia v.
