Its constitution had carefully balanced and separated powers, and it could rightly claim the honor of being the first to recognize a “bill of rights” that protected the people against arbitrary power. Political philosophers throughout the 17th and 18th centuries generally celebrated the British Constitution for protecting the individual rights of every class of citizen better than any other government in the world.  Nonetheless, to the outside observer, the accumulation of rights in the English system of government must have seemed like a process that was partly organic and partly a matter of happenstance—like the accretion of so many barnacles encrusting the ship of state over the years. The foundations and original reasons for many of England’s common law rights had been lost in the mists of time. And some of its most esteemed charters of rights, such as Magna Carta, had literally been wrested from the King by force. The American development of the Bill of Rights, by contrast, was meant to be a process of “deliberation and choice.” During the framing and ratifying periods, Americans deliberately selected the most cherished rights from the British tradition, but they would often provide their own rationales for these rights, incorporate them into their own unique institutions, and adapt them to their own situations.

The document was famously signed at Runnymede in 1215, where King John was forced at sword’s point to recognize or concede certain rights to his most powerful subjects. Subsequent monarchs entered more willingly into the agreement.  Some familiar political principles—principles that we recognize today as fundamental to the operations of good government—were first laid down in Magna Carta. For instance, someone accused of a crime should have the right to be confronted by witnesses against him and to be tried by a jury of his peers; and no punishments should be exacted except by due process of law (“unless by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land”).   Magna Carta was primarily designed to establish the proper relationship between noblemen and their King, but it would take a few centuries before many of these rights were recognized as the birthright of all freeborn male Englishmen. It would take even longer for women’s rights to be recognized.

The Writ of Habeas Corpus—often referred to as “the Great Writ”—means literally “produce the body” or “have the body.” The body in question is the person of the accused: the prisoner who, without this writ, may be detained for an indefinite period of time. The place where the body must be produced is a court of law; whenever a prisoner appeals to this writ, he is afforded the opportunity to challenge the legality of his detention.  Although the development of what became known as the “rights of Englishmen” was truly the product of centuries, probably the single greatest influence on Americans’ understanding of what it meant to institute constitutional protections for individual rights was England’s 1689 Bill of Rights. The Bill included protections that would be familiar to us today, such as the freedom of speech (for members of Parliament), the possession of arms (for Protestants), and prohibitions against “cruel and unusual punishments” (presumably for all). England’s charters of freedom had come a long way since the time of Magna Carta, but they were still a far cry from the liberal democratic freedoms we often take for granted today.

It was perhaps inevitable, then, that when Great Britain began to encroach upon some of their most cherished rights, the colonists would rise up in arms.   Long before Americans became students of the natural rights of man they were already acutely protective of their inherited rights as Englishmen. Although American colonists relied on Enlightenment natural rights philosophies in order to justify their final separation from Great Britain, they had first made several appeals to the Crown complaining that Parliament was violating their birthright as English subjects. Today the introductory part of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated for its ringing affirmations of the rights of man. But few notice (or perhaps understand) its allegation that the King had assented to “abolishing the free System of English Laws” in Quebec, followed by a not-so-subtle hint that he intended to do the same thing in the American colonies.

But unlawful imprisonment is different; “confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.” The Writ of Habeas Corpus is designed to prevent these kinds of arbitrary and indefinite detentions. The Writ of Habeas Corpus was therefore instrumental in establishing the judiciary as a powerful branch of government, formidable enough to check executive tyranny.

This fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English colonies probably than in any other people of the earth; and this from a great variety of powerful causes...  First, the people of the colonies are descendants of Englishmen. England, Sir, is a nation, which still I hope respects, and formerly adored, her freedom. The colonists emigrated from you when this part of your character was most predominant; and they took this bias and direction the moment they parted from your hands. They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to English ideas, and on English principles.  Americans no doubt jealously guarded their liberties in part because it was their English inheritance. But they also expanded and sometimes transformed the traditional English understanding of rights. They adapted them to institutions that were more democratic; they interpreted them in light of the Enlightenment philosophies of natural rights; and, ultimately, they applied them to a federal arrangement that had no real precedent in the English model.
