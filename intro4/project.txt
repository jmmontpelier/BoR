Over the course of its history, the courts have interpreted many of the first ten amendments in ways that are very different from what the Framers had in mind when they were originally adopted. We will discuss those individual interpretive changes as we discuss each of the first ten amendments.  But before we do that, we must discuss what is probably the greatest general change that has occurred in the interpretation of the Bill of Rights in the past 200 years, a change that is called the “Incorporation Doctrine.” It is through this doctrine that, following the passage of the 14th Amendment, most of the individual rights named in the Bill of Rights have been “incorporated against the states.” This means that most of the Bill of Rights now protects us from incursions on our individual rights whether committed by our state governments or the national government.  There are many ways in which the meanings of individual rights named in the Bill of Rights have changed since the time they were adopted. For instance, the 1st Amendment guarantee of “freedom of speech” has been interpreted more broadly to mean “freedom of expression.” And some rights not explicitly mentioned in any of the first ten amendments, such as a right to privacy, have been identified as constitutional rights.

It was the only time in which the United States resolved a constitutional issue (slavery) not by force of argument but by force of arms. Immediately after the defeat of the slaveholding Confederacy, three new amendments were ratified which fundamentally changed the Constitution: the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, commonly called the Reconstruction Amendments.  The 13th Amendment (1865) prohibited slavery throughout the United States; the 14th Amendment (1868) mandated certain standards of fairness and equality in how those former slaves could be treated; and the 15th Amendment (1870) sought to guarantee the voting rights of former slaves—at least former male slaves. These changes were so fundamental that some scholars consider the Reconstruction Amendments to have created a second American Constitution.  The Constitution of 1787 contained very few limitations on the powers of state governments, and the Bill of Rights had not added any more to that list. The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, however, were intended to place some serious restrictions on what the states could do.

One such interpretation occurred in 1925, in Gitlow v. New York, a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court considered whether the 1st Amendment’s protection of freedom of expression applied to the states.   This was not the first time that “incorporation” had been urged upon the Court. Scholars and litigants had been making such arguments for years, many of them arguing for “total incorporation”—that is, a blanket interpretation applying all of the Bill of Rights to the states. The Court had always rejected such arguments.  But in Gitlow, the Court began a careful process that has come to be called “selective incorporation.” Still refusing to incorporate the entirety of the Bill of Rights, the Court adopted the more limited proposition that “[f]or present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press—which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress—are among the fundamental personal rights and ‘liberties’ protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.” Thus, the Court focused upon the word “liberty” in the 14th Amendment and decided that if a right mentioned in the Bill of Rights is important enough, if it is “fundamental” enough, then it should be incorporated against the state governments.

Connecticut (1937)]. After Gitlow, it would be up to the Court to decide which other rights named in the Bill of Rights should, or should not, be deemed “fundamental” enough to be incorporated.  Identifying the particular rights that should be incorporated has been a matter of contention ever since. Some justices, such as Hugo Black, believed that all of the rights protected by the Bill of Rights should be incorporated, but that position has never commanded a majority of the Supreme Court. Instead, over the several decades following Gitlow, the Court selectively incorporated most of the Bill of Rights on a case-by-case basis.  This selective approach has meant that some rights would almost inevitably be left out, and, indeed, several provisions in the Bill of Rights—such as the grand jury requirement in the 5th Amendment and the right to a civil jury trial in the 7th Amendment—have never been recognized as applying to the states. The selective approach has also meant that the process of incorporation has been lengthy: the 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms was not incorporated until 2010.

Now, all states are bound by the same standards by which the federal government is bound, at least for those rights that have been incorporated. There are a few exceptions to this uniformity.

State laws, on the other hand, frequently present questions of constitutionality. Are the local police following the proper warrant procedures before searching a building? Does a city ordinance against strip clubs violate a stripper’s freedom of expression? Is the death penalty cruel and unusual punishment when it is applied to a juvenile offender?

He insisted that Americans had implicitly accepted “a second Bill of Rights.” He explained that our government “had its beginning, and grew to its present strength, under the protection” of those rights named in the old Bill of Rights: “They were our rights to life and liberty.” Since the time of the industrial revolution, however, “these political rights proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness.” What was needed in America at that time, Roosevelt thought, was a dedication to those rights that would lead to economic security: “The right of every family to a decent home;” “The right to adequate medical care”; and “The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment.” A guarantee of those newer rights would establish economic security, and he urged Congress to implement “this economic bill of rights.”  Many of the goals that Roosevelt wished to achieve have subsequently been enacted through ordinary legislation, but they have never been adopted as part of America’s Bill of Rights. That means that people have a legal right to certain kinds of government assistance when they are in need, but the kinds or amount of government assistance can and does change from one administration to the next. Many other countries have opted to incorporate these kinds of economic rights into their constitutions, which (theoretically, at least) make them more static and uniform.

The rights he was describing as economic were not merely an expansion of the existing kinds of rights that we have always enjoyed under the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; rather, he was introducing an entirely different kind of right. The American Founders were familiar with three important kinds of rights: one was natural and the other two—civil and political—followed from the natural kind. Natural rights are the ones that were given to us from the start and by nature: life, liberty, and property. Every person has the right to his own life; every person has the right to his own liberty; and every person has the right to whatever property he creates from the labor of his own hands. Those gifts of nature cannot be taken from people by anyone, even by the government, except under very particular circumstances. The government can only take away our liberty or property either as a punishment for a crime or through laws that have been passed with our consent. These exceptions to an otherwise absolute claim on our natural rights are what lead to civil and political rights.
